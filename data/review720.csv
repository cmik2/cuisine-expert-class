"Paul H.","This place is awesome, some of the best Sushi we have had in the bay area. Daniel creates plates of Sushi that are custom made and you can't get any better or fresh Sushi in the bay area.","5"
"Jessica P.","Not only does the sushi at Amakara melt in your mouth, it is extremely flavorful and the presentation is beautiful.
My favorite roll is the Spicy Crunchy Rainbow roll. It's seriously a punch in the mouth. If you order the spicy tuna roll, ask for them to put tempura bits in it. They will glady do it for you and it's amazing!
They have a full bar-- and if you come at the right time, the chefs at the sushi bar will periodically yell out SAKE BOMB and then each down their own. It's pretty entertaining. I really like the cucumber mint mojito, even if it comes in a smaller glass.
And, if possible, you really have to save room for dessert. The tempura ice cream is a treat (and they will bring it out for free on your birthday), but my FAVORITE is the Strawberry Monaka--vanilla ice cream waffle sandwiches with chocolate and strawberries!
The restaurant itself is clean, and the tables are made of granite. Everything is really nice--even the bathrooms. And all the waiters I've had are really friendly.
The other thing I love about this place is that it is super accommodating for big groups--not only because they will push tables together for you right away, but because of their menu choices. You can easily bring someone that doesn't like sushi--the teriyaki beef plate is a delicious and generous meal on its own. I would order it every time if I didn't come for the sushi. Also, the grilled eda-mami and tempura vegetables are awesome appetizers. We order them every time.
Honestly, my experience has never gone wrong at Amakara. It's the best sushi I've ever had for its price. The only negative comment I could give is that sometimes they get backed up and the sushi rolls take forever to come out. But that could be seen as a good thing when you're enjoying good food with good friends.","5"

"Peggy S.","This was an eye-opening experience for me, and I must say this is one of my favorite Japanese restaurants!
Sophia C. and I came here after going to the zucchini festival. We weren't too hungry but as soon as we saw the menu, between the both of us, we ordered two rolls (and they were HUGE!), an appetizer, and an entree. And we pretty much finished all of them!
We ordered grilled edamame for appetizer - I've never had it grilled before but oh wow, I loved the smoky, charred flavor. The simple seasoning (tossed with olive oil and salt) really brought out the earthy flavor of the edamame. The portion was also huge - despite me trying hard to rip open every single pod, I had a full box left over to take home (which I devoured as soon as I got back to San Jose).
For the entree, we ordered teriyaki beef, which came with rice and a side salad. I enjoyed the teriyaki beef immensely - normally, grilled items are not something I'd order at a Japanese restaurant (I am all about raw fish!), but this one was really tasty! The thinly sliced meat pieces were still a little pink, and very juicy. The teriyaki sauce was not overpowering - the slightly gooey, sweet and saltiness complimented the meat well.
We also ordered Tropical Punch (roll) and Italian Dragon (roll). Normally, I am a little skeptical about adding non-Asian items (such as cream cheese or pesto, etc) or fruits in my sushi... I am old school like that... but wow, these rolls were amazing! First, they were HUGE! Twice the size of the rolls you get at ordinary Japanese restaurants. Second, the rolls actually taste good! Who would have thought the pesto in Italian Dragon would taste so good with eel? And the refreshing mango in Tropical Punch smoothed out the kick of the spicy tuna!
The service was fast, our waitress was very attentive. The restaurant is clean, and the dim lighting gives the place a very modern atmosphere. They also have a full bar! I can't wait to go back!","5"
"Richie C.","Let's get one thing straight: this is not a sushi house. This is a Japanese restaurant that serves authentic Japanese cuisine with a few rolls on the side. If you're looking for a strictly sushi, look elsewhere.
Here are a few of the dishes I recommend.
Hamachi Kama: Grilled Yellowtail collar (a must!!)
Rib Eye Steak: with arugula and garlic soy butter
Toro: Fatty tuna (when available)
Uni Hand roll: Sea Urchin
Chirashi: assorted Sashimi over rice
The service is great, the food is wonderful, the atmosphere is fun, and the price is fair. I don't mind spending a pretty penny for extremely fresh seafood. Probably THE freshest in the Tri-Valley.","5"
"Vivi N.","We went there recently for a birthday and I have to say for Dublin/Pleasanton, I was pleasantly surprised. For a large group of 20, the service was very good, our waitress was very attentive and always made sure our glasses were full and food was on the table. The selection of sushi rolls were great, with lots of tasty combinations - like mango with salmon and soft shell crab. I can't remember the name of that roll, but very yummy!
You have to definitely try the grilled edamame and you can't go wrong with their cocktail menu either. Very good! A little pricey, but sushi is not the kind of food to skimp out on.","5"
"Amy T.","Wow. I am impressed. Clean, sophisticated decor, excellent service, unique sushi rolls, fresh food...FANTASTIC!!!
So delicious! Prices are a little bit on the higher side, but for the nice atmosphere, beautiful presentation and high quality food it's worth a couple extra bucks.
I enjoyed a unique and fantastically prepared dish called ""the trio"" - two shrimp tempura, unagi and tuna (maguro) served over sushi rice. they were nice enough to substitute the maguro for salmon sashimi at no extra cost. the tempura was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of batter, generous portions of salmon and unagi and the sushi rice was cooked and seasoned perfectly. well worth $19 and i was stuffed!!
friendly and efficient service from the wait staff and busboys. so polite, too. gotta love it!!
i am definitely coming back here!","5"
"James G.","I have offically given up trying to find a better sushi place in the East Bay. Over the last few years, I have spent an obscene amount of $$$ on other sushi spots in the East Bay trying to find the best. But after my first visit to Amakara, i have decided to just give them my $$$ from now on!
From what I understand, there are better spots in SF. But I do not live in SF :)","5"
"Dave T.","I really like their weekday lunch menu - I can get a nice variety of my favorites all in one sitting with their combo plates - and you always have enough left over for dinner that evening. Have taken several co-workers and clients there for lunch and so far, everyone loves the place!","5"
"Jon B.","Awesome sushi. Friendly service. MONKFISH LIVER!!
Went to this place for lunch on a Wednesday. It was pretty busy inside, but there were still a few tables open so we were seated quickly. After looking over the menu for a while trying to make a decision, we went with the Ankimo appetizer ($8, Monk Fish Liver, always gotta get the unique stuff), the assorted sashimi appetizer ($11, tuna, salmon, hamachi), seaweed salad ($5), a Jalepeno Hamachi Roll ($7, hamachi, avocado, and jalepeno), a Spicy Crunchy Rainbow Roll ($16, Rainbow roll w/ tempura shrimp, spicy tuna, spicy teriyaki sauce, mustard sauce,
tobiko, tempura bits & green onion), two Oyster shooters ($5, Raw oyster, quail egg yolk, tobiko, spicy ponzu & green onion in sake), and a bottle of sake that was not on the menu, but our server was nice enough to suggest when we asked about sake, only $19!
After a little while and a couple little mixups (we got an extra salad and miso soup we didnt order, but ended up being given no charge), we got the seaweed salad and the shooters. The seaweed salad was one of the best I've had, very fresh with a good amount of sesame seeds/oil. The shooters were awesome! Pretty big, but you have to try and take them all at once. The fresh oyster went great with the fresh quail egg. Awesome stuff.
Next came the Ankimo, which was AMAZING. It was much bigger that I expected, and sliced into thick coin like pieces. I was surprised at just how good it was-- it was like foie gras, VERY fatty and smooth. It's pretty much fish foie gras. Not a hint of standard liver flavor. Delicious!
The assorted sashimi appetizer came with six medium sized pieces, a good quick sampler of their basic sashimi. All three fish were very fresh and flavorful, although the salmon wasn't quite as buttery as I've had it before.
The Jalepeno Hamachi was nice and light. The pieces were on the smaller side, with fresh hamachi and small pieces of non-hot jalepenos. It was somehow delicate and refreshing, more of an appetizer or palate cleanser.
The Spicy Crunchy Rainbow Roll was the main attraction. At $16, its on the expensive side, but it's worth it. It was huge and looked awesome. It was a great mix of fresh fish, standard heat spicy, creamy spicy, crunchy, squishy, goodness, with red tobiko, which I don't see very often. It was very filling.
Everything at Amakara was delicious and the service was excellent. I can't wait to go back to have some more monkfish liver and try out other rolls.","5"
"Lisey W.","This is one of our favorite spots in the area and we go there just about every week. They have a lot of regulars now including us. Ask the sushi chefs to create a sushi roll for you - just tell them what kind of fish you like! Get the tuna tartare salad - it's exotic and delicious. We also love their ramen!","5"
"Mag R.","5+++ A++++ One of the best Japanese restaurants we have been to, and we've been to a lot of them in different places across the country.
In fact, my daughter who never likes raw fish before couldn't get enough of their hamachi sashimi. She said it melted in her mouth. It's just that good!
Highly recommended. We're going back again and again!","5"
"David D.","The fish is always fresh and service is good. Sometimes it can be challenging to get in for dinner w/o a 15-30 minute wait. The Sashimi tower, Lime Scallop roll, Grilled Edamame and Hamachi Jalapeño roll are our favorites. Out of the dozen or so sushi places in our area this has become our favorite and regular place.","5"
"Jennifer C.","We LOVE this place :) for lunch, dinner and even a private party!!!
We were searching for a restaurant to celebrate our daughter's baptism and needed a place that could accommodate 110 people and was reasonably priced. We went here for dinner and loved the food, the service and ambiance. . . so we decided to ask if they could accommodate a private party. It was their 1st time accommodating a party of 110 people. . . but they did an awesome job!!! Jaime & Tay, the co-owners, are great and such sweet people!!! They are so awesome, they even hired my friend as a bartender :)
Our family & friends were so impressed with the service & food during our party. . . a few months later our friends also had their daughter's baptism lunch here!
GREAT, GREAT, GREAT place!!!","5"
"ME M.","This place rocks. Good food, Fast Service even when its jumpin, Nice people, and the price is just right.
BTW: I spent $100.0 including tip for an all you can eat place that replaced house of sake. I usually spent 35 -55 for the same exact order.
I spent about 50 here and got hamachi kama which I don't get too often and use as a litmus test for sushi places. The Hamachi Kama was Awesome, cooked to perfection. The Wasabi tobiko was perfect, could be a little more spice for my likes, but was good. The rollse were pretty big and a great value. So if you go here, and intend on buying the usual 4 to 5 item order prepare for some left overs. I'm gonna finish that awesome spicy ramen we ordered.
The only suggestion for management of this place is to add sukiyaki beef to menu. Its fast to prepare and sooo delicious. Thats the thing we missed most from the old House of Sake, Too bad its not the same place anymore.
Anyhow I highly recommend this place, so far its the best we've eaten at in the tri valley.","5"
"Jedd J.","Amakara made the best roll I've ever had: Hamachi, avacado, jalapeno
Excellent bar tender, great cocktails.
The spicy ramen was cough-reflex hot...awesome!","5"
"Charlie K.","A word to those of you who gave this place a poor rating because of ""slow service"" ; if you want fast food go to McDonalds....and don't exaggerate the wait time because you're impatient...","5"
"kavita m.","love love love this place. excellent sushi and ambience. Try the sushi bar, it's always happening and if you happen to be lucky enough, you can have one of eddie's special rolls thats not on the menu. I have never gone wrong with any sushi here.
Rock on!","5"
"Sophie P.","I come to this place 3-4 times per week and have an exceptional experience every time!! The chefs at the sushi bar are super attentive and it's always a good time.
Service and speed is almost always compromised when you sit at a table, nothing to complain about though if you have good company, sake bombs and time to kill. I do know that this place packs the house... hopefully management will take your reviews to heart and make some changes. I'd hate for such a killer place continue to get such shoddy experiences.
The fish is ALWAYS fresh and tastes amazing. Probably the best sushi experience I've ever had. I've taken soo many friends and they are all hooked. The BF wasn't blown away the first time I took him- but i believe going back and giving it a 2nd try makes all the difference. He loves the place now- and can't get enough.
Because we go there so often, we know most of the workers by name and even most of the regulars... sitting at the sushi bar is a great place to make new friends and share some sake and even your rolls.
MUST TRY: grilled edamame, scallop paradise, crab/cream cheese jalepenos, jerry roll (this roll has no rice- just hamachi, salmon and spicy tuna) try the plum sake for dessert- sweet like a dessert wine- $5 a glass. SIT AT THE SUSHI BAR!! Talk to your neighbors- have a drink...OH! You must try a cucumber gimlet too--- mmmm...
If you didn't enjoy your experience the first time, I suggest you give it one more shot!","5"
"Rachelle G.","I'm a sushi snob, big time sushi snob. I've had my favorite restaurant in SF for over 10 years, and one visit to Amakara, and I'm converted.
The atmosphere is spotless, beautiful, modern, but also friendly. Staff are pleasant, and seem happy to be there. I did sit at the sushi bar, so I had a great conversation with the three sushi chefs.
The menu is outstanding with the usual sushi faire, and unique hybrid treats unique to Amakara. I decided to test out one of these, the Italian Dragon, a traditional dragon roll made with a twist... Eel, real crab, tempura shrimp, avocado, tomato, and basil pesto. Amazingly good!
Everything from the miso soup to the recommended green tea ice cream for desert was outstanding.
I stumbled upon this place on my way to a choir practice, and found my new place. It's worth the drive to Dublin, even if you're not in the area. Outstanding,","5"
