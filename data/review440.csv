"Brenna R.","I LOVE Amakara! The Hawaiian Delight Roll is to DIE FOR I could eat that roll everyday for the rest of my life!","5"
"Morgan L.","I know it's a bold statement, but this place is arguably the best sushi restaurant in the Bay Area. Without exaggeration, my fianc√© and I have eaten here at least 4-5 times a month for the last 2 years and have not had single bad meal/ experience.
Sure, it's always busy, but it's definitely worth the wait. The fish is incredibly fresh, the menu options are great and the staff is attentive. Anyone who has ever been in the service industry can recognize that this place runs like a well-oiled machine, given the volume they see on a nightly basis.
Menu items that are a must try:
Grilled Edemame
Scallop Paradise
Soft Shell Crab Handroll
Hamachi Carpaccio
Spicy Seared Ahi Tuna Roll","5"
"Michael K.","Had a dinner with the family and the manager did s great job accommodating us even though we had s bit of a wait.","5"
"Hanh P.","Been here a couple times now and have yet to be disappointed. The quality of the food is on point. There is always a wait especially at dinner time but its worth it, in my opinion. They're equipped with a full bar with a wide selection of mixed drinks, beers, and wines. I've only experience their happy hour once and with 3 glasses of Sapporo, it came out to only be $7.50; which is a great deal considering that's a typical price of 1 drink. Their foods on the other hand is a little more expensive. The specialty rolls run between $15-20 each. I suppose that makes up for the cheap drinks. In the end, you pay for what you get.","5"
"Leslie Y.","This is probably my favorite sushi restaurant. I usually get the sashimi salad, salmon lomi, three of a kind, and anything served raw.
I am not a fan of other places who drown their rolls with sauce. I prefer plain and fresh sushi with simple ingredients done right.
Service is typically on point, however, wait time can be long, but I always find myself at the bar having a beer or two to kill time.","5"
"Jason G.","My new sushi spot! Great atmosphere food and service! Hands down best Oyster shooters and Uni shooters anywhere! The grilled edamame is a must!!!","5"
"Sheila D.","The quality of the food makes up for everything else.
I've only been here a handful of times but Friday evening there is always a wait and it is always worth it. I like sitting at the sushi bar to catch the basketball game or whatever sports event is on. The sushi chefs are there from early morning until late evening so be nice to them!
I love the grilled edamame with olive oil and garlic salt. They serve the best sashimi salad. Their sesame chicken reminded me of San Tung in San Francisco.
Aaaaand now I'm hungry.","5"
"Erin S.","The sushi here is amazingly good, but the wait is long. They are always packed because the food is to die for, but it makes for a long wait. Go hungry knowing you will have to wait or order pickup!","5"
"Cesar B.","They take a common dish and turn it into something you've never tried before. Incredible food and drinks unique to this restaurant. I'm not big on tea but try their sweet ice green tea and you will convert but this usually runs out by Thursday. Yes, their house-made tea is so good once keg runs out they won't make it until Sunday.
I challenge anyone to try their grilled edamame and say it's not the best they've tried. I've tried getting this app elsewhere and no one makes it like they do here. How about another app, shrimp ceviche? House made chips with fresh ceviche made different from any other I've had and this bar none wins by a mile.
If simple drinks and apps are this imagine the rest of the the menu. I've probably recommended and brought at least thirty people to this restaurant and now every single person frequents this place.
Service is hit or miss. Some of the of the waiters are great and others just ok but never had bad experience. #bestsushi","5"
"Lorie N.","I've been here countless of times and everytime I come here, it's always busy! They have the best appetizer and sushi here! My friends always takes me here and I ended up paying ""nada"" lol.","5"
"Marlaina M.","I would say this place is one of my tops favorite sushi places to enjoy great sushi! FRESH and DELICIOUS!
I was recommended by an associate at Office Depot saying "" there's somewhere around the corner that has lines out the door on the weekends"" and Ding! I was there 20 mins later!
GREAT customer service and the intricate rolls were pricy, but totally worth the price! It satisfied all my taste buds!
I would give this place a big thumbs up!!! Absolutely love that they have a bar too! Love the atmosphere!","5"
"Sulayman B.","Love the Sushi here! My favorite has to be the Lemon Scalops! Don't let the waitress tell you its too lemony like they did the last time! Crunchy rolls are always amazing! The Asparagus wrapped in beef! Yum! Spicy with jalapenos! Be sure to be ready for a long wait at night so get there early as you can or have someone from your group put your name down. Service is friendly but can get overwhelmed when they have a rush. Great place for kids and getting together with your frineds.","5"

"Norell F.","I love this place. Really only go during the week though because it's crazy busy Friday, Saturday, and Sunday unless you get there right when they open. The sushi is always supper fresh and looks beautiful can no wait to go back.","5"
"Esther K.","Woooooooow, busy restaurant for a Wednesday it was packed with people waiting for tables at around 6. They have nice sushi bars, great place for those who want to enjoy a nice ball game with a classier vibe.
Anywho we ordered a bunch of appetizers which include seared eggplant steak(not sure what it is actually called), takoyaki, grilled fish, porkbelly and edemame.
Seared steak- on point, nice rareness and the meat was tender with soft eggplant on the inside.
Grilled fish chin (forgot what its called, hibachi? something japanese starts with an H)-this is my FAVORITE appetizer, the fish was fresh and grilled tender and juicy perfect with no strong fishy scent.
Grilled edemame- This is the first time I've eaten edemame grilled in olive oil, it was very interesting and brings out the flavor of the edemames even more!
Grilled porkbelly- This is also very good and goes well with alcohol, comes with a side of kimchi.
Takoyaki (octopus balls)- Very good! Has a nice moistness.
Since we ordered so many appetizers, we only got 3 main courses, which include 2 sushi rolls with a mixed sashimi combo.
Rolls were really good as well, fresh sashimi, great for people who like seafood and sashimi.
Overall, great experience! Good atmosphere and also great service we got a Japanese lady who was patient and constantly checked on your water/tea level (lol) would definitely come back again if I was in the area!","5"
