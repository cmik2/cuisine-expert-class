"Ashley K.","Bartender is so amazing, handsome and charismatic. Food is so dericious. Totally worth the wait. You can have lots of fun waiting at the bar. Woo hoo
Grilled edamame is yumz and love the Oscar the Grouch drink.","5"
"K. T.","Tried this restaurant for the first time this past weekend. Definitely one of the best Japanese restaurants around, so be sure to reserve in advance, or you will face a long wait for a table. (Thankfully, we were seated away from the holding area at the front. )
Foodwise, the sushi and sashimi were ""melt in your mouth"" delicious and incredibly fresh. A highlight was the yummy creation called the Italian Dragon Roll, complete with basil pesto. Not a single food complaint from our group of ""expense account"" type diners.
Although the restaurant is somewhat noisy, the ambience is relaxed, dress is casual and the service was as attentive as one might find at ""fancier"" restaurants. Chairs were amazingly soft --perfect for settling into while visiting with friends on a Saturday night. We also felt that the tab was very reasonable, given the superior quality of the food.
In short, we loved it and are certain to return!","5"
"Brian R.","Wow. This is an amazing Japanese restaurant. I came in with a group of coworkers on a Tuesday night and the place was pretty busy. Fortunately, we had made reservations and were seated immediately. Not food related, but I want to point out their their chairs are pretty comfortable. Food wise, it's probably among the top 10 Japanese restaurants I've been too. I'm personally on a low-carb diet, so I did not partake in the sushi, but there were plenty of other options to choose from. Dishes I did dine on include:
Sashimi Salad
Hamachi Carpaccio
Tuna Ceviche
Tako Kimchee Salad
Grilled Edamame
Aspargus Beef Wrap
Of those items, I want to specifically call out the sashimi and tako kimchee salads as well as the asparagus beef wrap. The amount of fish included with the sashimi salad is impressive, and the flavors of the tako kimichee and beef wraps were amazing. I'll probably have to order them again when I return. Combine the three and you've got a pretty impressive, and healthy, dinner for two.
On the sushi side, while I did not have any myself, my coworkers ordered about 6-7 rolls and the artistic detail the chefs put into each roll exemplifies the pride they have in their work. And from the comments, it would seem that the flavor of each roll was equally excellent.","5"
"Marcie C.","Wow! That ahi ceviche salad is amazing! Great combination of acid with fresh fish and greens. And the lavash just set it apart! I found their noodle soup to be super Korean spicy (I'm a total wuss), but flavorful. I enjoyed every piece of sushi and loved the green tea ice cream! Only downside is that we couldn't get reservations until 8pm, but that was our fault for not calling ahead sooner! Yummy!","5"
"Step By Step L.","Excerent ! is the word this place deserve....very busy place but very very good rolls and fresh sashimi. When a Japanese satisfied That mean... you better try!! Great job !","5"
"Caitlin C.","Screw coming here for the typical California rolls and chicken teriyaki entrees! Although I'm sure they're delish, I'd suggest going for amakara's special creations! After much difficulty, we ended up going for 3 of amakara's original rolls:
1. Italian dragon roll ($14 - eel, crab, tempura shrimp, avocado, tomato, and basil pesto)
2. Hawaiian Delight ($15 - salmon, pineapple, bacon, mustard sauce, Tabasco, red onion, tomato)
3. Tropical Punch ($15 - unagi, spicy tuna, cucumber, topped with mango slices with mango sauce)
All 3 of the rolls were on point. Even though they seem a little pricy, the rolls are HUGE (8-10 pieces each), taste amazing, and are made with such careful attention to detail that you immediately forget the prices once you pop that first piece of sushi into your mouth. Who would have thought pesto sauce, tomatoes, pineapples, and bacon would go well on sushi??? And who has 4 different types of miso soup (soft shell crab miso, grilled eggplant miso, wakame tofu miso, and spicy miso)!? Apparently amakara does, and for that they have stolen my heart. It doesn't help that every single thing on the entire menu sounded - and looked - amazing, since each dish brought to other tables looked like heaven on a plate. AMAKARA I WILL SEE YOU AGAIN. Just gotta wait for that next paycheck though cause I am def ballin on a budget here :p","5"
"Jade K.","This is my FAVORITE sushi place in Tri-Valley. I love sitting at the sushi bar watching the chefs artfully make all these sushi and special rolls that are too good to eat, but I must eat them anyway! Sitting at the sushi bar is great spot as most of the regular patrons are very friendly and usually will share their sushi and sake with you. Their salad and dinner dishes come in big portion, and artfully presented.
The sushi and service are always on the mark. The sushi chefs always have a SMILE on their faces (you never see them unhappy!).
They have three or four large screen TVs where you can watch sport games, while waiting for your sushi to be made.
This place is always busy and packed on weekends, and sometimes on weeknight.","5"
"Manny P.","My wife brought me here for my birthday lunch. We brought our baby in carrier with us. They were very accommodating. The food was reasonably priced. The waitress was very nice and we received our food in a timely manner. Will definitely return for dinner.","5"
"Joan H.","Excellent sushi! Huge portions and super-fresh ingredients. Best in the East Bay!","5"
"Gary A.","Simply the best sushi place in the neighborhood! We have been maybe a dozen times and we have never been disappointed. The fish is ssooo fresh and the presentation is perfection. Any of the original rolls rock, but try the Hamachi Carpaccio, or the Hamachi Kama as a starter. It is also a very good value, order the Nigiri and you get a nice sized wide piece of perfect fish hanging over both ends of the rice, The staff is always friendly and while weekends the service has suffered in the past, the last two trips it was great. BIG TIP...Make a reservation on the weekends or be preapred to wait an hour or more.","5"
"Hetty H.","This place is always packed! Their sashimi is always fresh and rolls are yummy. I've tried several other Japanese restaurants in the area and always find myself coming back here. Food is on the pricier side but well worth it!
Great ambiance and roomy enough for stroller/kids. They have big comfy chairs and tables.","5"
"C. J.","For Japanese food fans looking for a great sushi spot that offers more than just sushi, this is the place! The grilled edamame is amazing as is the beef teriyaki. Excellent service as well.","5"
"Arlynn A.","Best jap spot in the dublin/pleasanton area.
been here a few times already for both lunch and dinner. you do get more bang for your buck during lunch since bento like meals are only available during 11:30-2pm (M-F)
2 item $10
3 item $14
Def get the tempura ice cream for dessert. YUM!","5"
"Jeffrey U.","Been here twice in the last week. Outstanding in my opinion. Wonderful service, nice people and really good ankimo and uni (two standards for a sushi bar)!","5"
"Debra M.","This is my all time favorite Japaanese Restaurant. I could eat here everyday. I've never had a bad meal.","5"
"kelly l.","This is one of my favorite sushi places right now. I've been here a total of 5 times (4x dine-in, 1x take out) for the past 2 months. My most favorite things I order here are the Italian Dragon Roll (who would've known to match pesto with sushi? It's brilliant!), The Klondike Express, their Sashimi Mix and the Tuna Ceviche Salad. The presentation of this salad is nice, but the downside is that it's a little difficult to eat! Don't forget the cold sake! The only downside is that it's really busy...so service is hit or miss here....and there's a wait for tables if you don't have a reservation here.","5"
"Todd D.","IMO best sushi in the Dublin/SR/Pleasanton area.
Dragon Roll and Spicy Sesame Tuna was delicious! Great taste, fresh and a good touch of spice to them.
My daughter who is one of the most pickiest eaters wiped the tempura plate clean!
That says a lot.
Great bar w/TV's for those who want to try and sneak in and take that route. Otherwise, it does get pretty packed so just be prepared to wait for a bit. We will definitely return.","5"
"Marlene B.","This is the best fresh sushi will you find in our area (Dublin, Pleasanton, San Ramon) If you like sushi, you will not be disappointed!
Amakara has the TV's on at the bar so you can peek at the game too ;)
My one warning, do not plan to rush through dinner...it is an experience here, not fast food!
E-ta-da-ki-mas!","5"
"Bryan B.","This place is awesome. Excellent food, great prices, staff was just the right amount of friendly and you must try the unfiltered sake. My favorite sushi was: spicy tuna roll and the spicy spider roll. Ann was the waitress and she was quite nice and very helpful. Have been here before and will go back in the future.","5"
"BriannSandy W.","Just a few days before her work holiday/christmas/winter/whatever non offensive politically correct party adjective we are supposed to use these days, Sandy needed to pick up a few gifts and a Christmas ornament at Michael's crafts.
But before I could even begin to handle a trip to the testosterone challenging craft store, I needed an adult beverage and quality meal
It had really been a tough week, I gave Sandy a call about 6pm and said, ""You want me to make dinner tonight or would you like me to take you out?"" Having had enough of corporate America or corporate Tri Valley to be specific, she said, ""Oh %^$@ that, let's go out so I can have a nice drink,"" Sandy replied in her honest and loveable East Oakland accent.
Not sure how that demand for a week ending cocktail and much needed meal got us to Amakara, but not much later, we found ourselves waiting for a table for two.
We arrived at about 7pm and found our favorite local Japanese restaurant full with a 30 minute wait for a table. But remembering how good our food was the last time we thought nothing of the wait.
15 minute later we were seated. Sandy immediately ordered her cocktail. She went with a local spin Tokyo Tea complete with a fancy umbrella and I chose their spin of an old favorite, the Kamakazi. She enjoyed her Tokyo tea and I found my Kamikaze to be a bit sweet but effective. Although, the combination of the reddish color and martini glass screamed chick drink, quickly downing the slightly feminine beverage in two manly swigs helped me regain the man-cred the drink initially caused me to lose.
We ordered the asparagus wrapped in steak with a ponzu sauce, hamachi kama, tonkatsu and 5 pieces of tuna sashimi.
The asparagus was without a doubt the most impressive highlight. Followed by my tonkatsu that was not just a fried cutlet but a juicy piece of pork that simply melted in my mouth. Next was the sashimi, deep red, cold and firm tasting just hours from the sea. The tuna collar was as tasty as last time. Grilled to perfection. Slightly salty, smoky and juicy.
Having been rushed slightly on our last visit, this time we were handled with care. Our server was efficient but let us enjoy our time.
Tonight we loved our food and enjoyed our service. We were seated quicker than expected, our food was amazing, drinks tasty and our service almost as good as our asparagus was tasty.
We finished our lovely meal washed down by our tasty beverages, paid our check and headed to Michael's.
While our week at the office had been challenging at best. And a much unanticipated trip to Michael's loomed just minutes away, two strong cocktails and dinner at our little local gem was just what we needed.
Five stars for not just the best sushi in town, but for some of the best sushi anywhere around.","5"
