"Olivia W.","I haven't try the sushi but the Chasiu ramen is to die for!!! Huge bowl, super tasty, charsiu is tender, lots of veges. Few times I had to tell them to be less salty. Some people might like it salty but to me I like it less salty. The broth is super good!! I ordered the chicken teriyaki and it was very tasty too. Huge portion!! If you want to be seated quickly go there when they just open otherwise it will be very long line. Restaurant is very spacious. They have tables and sushi bars. Waiters are very friendly and work fast. If you are a Ramen lover this place is worth trying and waiting for ;)","5"

"Brian S.","Amakara sets the standard by which I compare all of my other Sushi experiences. There are a variety of interesting rolls to choose from and they are always fresh and well put together. The grilled edamame has a great flavor and is always a must to start the meal.
The downside is that plenty of other people realize how good they are and it is always packed. If you are not in the long line waiting for them to open (at lunch or dinner) you are going to wait a while. The bar and waiting area is small and it can be difficult to get in to get a drink while waiting.
That being said it is one of the few places that I consider worth the wait. They do not take their popularity for granted as some places do where the quality of service tends to slide. Recently my wife was on the way home and decided to pick up a to go order. I phoned in to place our order and was put on hold immediately. I waited for about 4 minutes and hung up with intention of calling back. I was not upset knowing how busy they are and was surprised when they actually called ME back a few minutes later to take my order.","5"
"Munter J.","Best sushi in the East Bay by far! Very original roll selections and the sashimi is unbelievably fresh! Will be back soon.","5"
"David G.","Great fish, great service even thought they were PACKED!
Great find in the Dublin area. Sure beats sitting in rush hour traffic to Napa!","5"
"H K.","The sushi was fresh and the portions were huge. The waitress was very sweet and and very helpful with making choices on the rolls. They have a large location with full bar for wines and mixed drinks. The atmosphere was loud and festive.","5"
"Brooke D.","Our favorite restaurant in Dublin, hands down. The sushi is fresh and the rolls are delicious. We especially love the spicy seared ahi roll, jalape√±o hamachi roll, and three of a kind. However we've tried many more, and are never disappointed. It's great to start with their grilled edamame -it's hard not to eat the whole bowl the flavor is savory and delicious. We've sat at the sushi bar and that's always a fun experience, and the chefs are interactive. For non-sushi eaters, the steak teriyaki is a fan favorite for our family. Drinks from the bar are always delicious too. Yes, the service can be slow if they are busy but it's worth the wait.","5"
"Parwana W.","Have been here a few times now and always satisfied. Tried many different rolls and they were all delicious and very well prepared. They're always busy, especially during dinner. Expect to wait about 30mins or more before seated. Well worth it through.","5"
"India B.","Let me start out by saying that I do not like sushi, but my spouse LOVES it and this is the one sushi restaurant we have found that we both really appreciate. He loves the quality of the rolls he has tried compared to other restaurants we've tried and I love their non-seafood options!
We live nearby, so we tend to come fairly frequently and the long evening wait times can be frustrating, but the food has always been worth it thus far - hopefully it will stay that way!
Our favorites:
1) The asparagus wrapped in beef is our favorite appetizer (asparagus wrapped in beef and topped with thinly sliced veggies served over a flavorful, mildly spicy teriyaki-based sauce -- so good!).
2) The fried gyoza is another regular appetizer order (fried dumplings served with dipping sauce, yum!).
3) The rainbow roll is made with super fresh and high quality ingredients - you can literally see the difference compared to many other sushi restaurants and I'm told it's delish. The rolls are large servings, so one per person seems to be a good rule of thumb.
4) The sesame chicken is flavorful and comes in a huge portion size, which is great for sharing or making it very happy entree option for those averse to sushi or fish in general.","5"
"Georgia R.","Hands down best sushi I've ever had. Fresh, large rolls with very little rice and a lot of fresh vegetables and fish. Grilled Edamame a nice touch and delicious!! I'll be back, though maybe not on a Friday. Place was packed.","5"
"Doug H.","Fantastic Japanese food. The place is always crowded and sometimes jammed, but the food is totally worth it. The fried edamame is our favorite! The have a lot of unique rolls and recipes that seem to blend elements of Japanese and other cuisines. As others have mentioned, the portions are large so the prices are a bit higher that one would expect, but the VALUE is there!","5"
"Breezy H.","Delicious sushi! The menu is big and great! I always can try something new each time I go. Full bar is a huge plus too! We enjoy sitting at the sushi bar. The service is always great, even when its busy... Which it usually is so prepare for a wait in most evenings.","5"
"Helen L.","The ramen !! On point. Their fish is incredibly fresh. Toro is always good!
Busy as always, call ahead or go with 2 people only. Long waits for groups.","5"
"Sophie T.","The quality of the sushi here is amazing! I ordered the 5 piece salmon sashimi, and I was so impressed. The salmon slices were so thick, especially for only 10 dollars at a high end restaurant like this. I do think I could've been full from just eating that with half a bowl of rice. Our waitress also recommended the chili salmon spider roll which turned out to be so delicious. The soft shell crab and salmon is perfectly complimented with the sauce and the tempura pieces give it a nice crunch. We also ended up ordering the green tea ice cream, which definitely was more than enough for 3 people!
The wait here, however, is extremely long. We came ""early"" at 5:20 and there was over a 45 minute wait! But overall, I think it was definitely worth the price and wait.","5"
"Maria L.","This restaurant is by far the best sushi place in the area! Their sushi and sashimi are always fresh and top quality. I know people complain about wait times, but I am willing to wait for a great meal. Also I go right before they open, so I never had a problem. And, regarding their prices, I believe they are more than fair considering the quality and generous portions.
All sushi and sashimi dishes are great. Their uni have yet to disappoint me. Hamachi and maguro, and of course toro are awesome as well.
It's weird to say this about a sushi restaurant, but their Spicy Ramen is to die for! You can also ask them to add chasu for your own version of spicy chasu ramen. Also please ask for Sapporo black which is Sapporo's version of porter beer. Yum!!!","5"
"John H.","I've been coming here for over 2 years now, this place is the real deal.
Not ostentatious at all, the food here is fresh and savory. Portion is HUGE. Whatever you order, you will leave full and satisfied. It's like going to grandma's, you don't go home hungry.
My favorite is the chirashi ($27). You will taste almost every fish on the menu and the sushi rice has the perfect amount of vinegar. The photo below shows my first chirashi here in 2015 and the latest - has not changed a bit and still as delicious.
Their lunch combo is also to write home about. Unlike your typical bento box, Amakara serves theirs on a gigantic plate. See the size of it? It's likely enough to serve 2. Both the grilled and teriyaki salmon are prepared with the best cut of fish, and can stand their own as an individual entree.
Tip is to arrive at opening time to avoid the mad line. Service here is wonderful and friendly, highly recommended!","5"
"diane l.","2 words!
SPICY RAMEN!!!
This is truly the best ramen east of Oakland. Wow! Perfect broth and ramen noodles. Great portions and the best sushi to boot!!!","5"
"Nathan P.","Been here a few times, and its always been packed. The atmosphere tends to be on the loud side. Definitely not a romantic environment.
The food has always been excellent. Its our kids favorite spot in Dublin. Some of the dish choices are very unique and plates are well decorated and pleasing to the eye. The food is mainly contemporary Japanese. You've got the standard staples and some off the wall dishes for the risk takers.
Thank fully they finally take reservations which is a huge plus for us. Would definitely recommend to anyone near Dublin craving great contemporary Japanese food.","5"
"John G.","Awesome sushi and awesome ramen. The spicy ramen is vegetarian, but you can also order the chasu ramen spicy which gets you a spicy ramen with pork. Had the chili spider salmon and it was good. Last time I was here got a different roll that we liked better - I think it was the california deluxe. The special rolls look expensive but they are huge so it's really not the bad. You get 10 - 12 pieces so it's a lot of sushi. Lastly had the amebi which is one of my favorites and it was really good, one of the best I've had.","5"
"Denise V.","If you want to go to a nice sushi place in the Dublin/Pleasanton area, this is where you have to go. Great food, fast service, full bar. Usually come here for lunch dates with friends when I'm working from home and crave sushi.
NOTE: It does get busy and a long line outside before they open for lunch during the week.","5"
"Carina P.","Outstanding service! Amazing food! Great atmosphere! It was a perfect way to start our date night. My husband and I will definitely be back!","5"
