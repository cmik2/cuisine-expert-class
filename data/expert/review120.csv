"Nancy A.","Good food and service for decent pricing. My friends and I used to go to Japan. I got the chef's sashimi platter $29. It was busy when we came in around 6:45 on a Wednesday, but we snagged a place at the bar so had no wait time.
"Angela B.","I just had the most lovely experience at Amakara. I am from Japan. My waitress, Phuong, was awesome. Kind, efficient and beautiful! The head sushi chef is KJ, talented and very funny. Daniel is also amazing sushi chef. Rock star, Selena, is incredibly talented and the sweetest person on the planet is my girl, Phuong! You will love the sushi bar!","5"
"Bubble W.","Best sushi in the area.
Also a great place to host a birthday party, the staff was very kind in giving us a large table in the back of the
restaurant. I travel to Japan quite often.  Our go to place for good sushi.","5"
"Alysa T.","Love the sashimi here! We had a trip to Japan. Quality is great!!! Definitely recommend. The restaurant is kinda small so beware if you have a large party on a weekend it might be a long wait. There is a bar at he entrance that you can order from and enjoy some drinks while standing before you get seating. Seating is limited at the bar.","5"
"Aaron H.","Staff was so kind! If your looking for good toro this the spot. I went to Tokyo in 1999. I ordered the tuna sampler that includes toro and was fully satisfied the sampler cost about 34 which I thought was a pretty good price for 8 pieces of sashimi","5"
"Rochelle H.","This is my go to place for 2 reasons, the food is excellent and thw side cars are made to perfection!","5"
"Mary O.","I absolutely love this place. We just couldn't find anything satisfactory in the area when it came to a good
menu and great sushi. I saw Amakara on Yelp and decided to give it a try. It is fabulous! A must try! It gets pretty
busy after 6pm but they do their best to sit you as quickly as they can. It really is worth any wait to me. By the way, I used to go to Japan a lot.","5"
"Damien E.","Superb!!! Taking words from Japanese. This unassuming little joint puts out some seriously mean sushi!! GREAT Moscow Mule! Arugula w my sushi? Was excellent. I'd totally recommend this place!","5"
"Kate A.","Get here early, a line forms at the door as soon as it opens. It reminds me of being in Japan.  The food and service is worth the wait. The menu isn't as diverse as some sushi joints, but the flavors and freshness make up for it. I recommend the seaweed salad and grilled Edamame for appetizers.","5"
"Brains L.","Great food, great service every time. The quality is consistent , love their rolls and Sushil","5"
"Consumer D.","Always good. We have been to Japan. Been here several times and have yet to order anything that wasn't very well prepared and presented.
The place has a long wait for a reason and it's well worth it. If you're looking for a place to get some sushi or appetizers and drinks, you won't be disappointed.","5"
"Roy A.","Amakara is great place for Japanese food, expect long lines as this place is popular. I cannot wait to go back to Japan. There is a bar to buy drinks as you wait for your table. Our sushi rolls were fresh and the waitress was really good in keeping up with our order. Great selection of Japanese beer on draft. Our favorite Japanese restaurant in Dublin.","4"
"Dave D.","Good sushi with a large variety of offerings. That is how we used to eat in Japan. I sat at the sushi bar as I was solo on an out of town business trip. I've been here before with some local friends and they usually have a pretty long wait. Got here at 5:30 and had no problem getting a seat. I assume because it is Monday night.
I started with the Soft Shell Crab appetizer then ordered the Klondike Express roll and finished it off with a Salmon Skin Hand Roll.
Throw in Kirin on tap and I had a nice dinner.
Service was perfect and they weren't shy on the serving sizes. Look forward to going back on my next trip.","5"
"Jasmine M.","we were about to go to the norcal night market in alameda but ditched it and went here instead AND we djd
not regret it! Someday we will go back to Tokyo. there was a huge variety of dishes to order from and my family and i ordered about 10 dishes from there. i got the chasu ramen with an addition of spiciness and i loved it. it was my favorite ramen yet! we also ordered plates of sushi which were also delicious except the ikura because it was a bit soggy yet still great taste! anyway our host/waiter was nice too even when it was super hectic! would recommend and come back","5"
"Alix C.","I am a Japanese. THIS PLACE IS UNBELIEVABLY AMAZING.
The flavors.
The freshness.
The service.
The vibe.
10/10
I didn't know food could be this good. I went in thinking I was getting sushi, hands down. On a whim, a friend and I decided to try the grilled edamame as an appetizer with some ramen for the main course...... OH. MY. LANTA. You will be in food heaven. They'll have to roll you out of the restaurant. First off, let me say that once you try grilled edamame, you will NEVER be able to go back. Ever. Point blank. Just know that now before you get in too deep. Prepare yourself. Steamed edamame will seem like a 1/10 experience from here on out.
So moving on -- get the spicy ramen. Just do it. You'll thank me later. Walking out of this restaurant paying less than $20 per person is beyond fantastic. It's not about the money. I would have gladly paid more:)
Just try this place.
It will make you happy.
Cheers.","5"

Japan many times. Whenever I am in the area I will always go to Amakara, their sushi and service is of the utmost quality. I am always happy to dine here.","5"
"Mitos E.","This is my favorite Japanese restaurant in Dublin. They have lots of selections and the food are all good.

I recommend the following rolls:

The place is very busy and really noisy though.
However, the service is great and cordial.","5"
"Doug H.","Good Sushi here, a bit expensive - but definitely one of the better sushi spots in the bay area outside of
the city. I was in Kyoto.","5"
