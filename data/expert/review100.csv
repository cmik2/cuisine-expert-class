"Felicia T.","I am Japanese recently moved to the area and I'm so happy to have discovered Amakara! This has become one of my favorite places to eat. Every time I eat here, it always seems to be very busy. The wait is typically around 45 minutes, but it is so worth the wait! The food here is amazing! My favorite is the nigiri. The fish is so fresh and the texture is so buttery! The price is pretty typical of any sushi restaurant. The fish is high quality so I think it's really worth it! I am writing this review after just finishing dinner here and I can't stop thinking about the next time I'll be back! I highly recommend giving this place a try!","5"
"Mia G.","I find it very difficult to stop coming here. My family and I are from Japan, and  always down to eat here. Despite having to wait over an hour on most occasions, it is all worth it!
They ensure to keep the integrity by being consistent with having high quality of food and hiring the best absolute employees. This place is amazing and I promised you, you won't be disappointed if you choose to dine in at this place.","5"
"Bradley H.","This place is our go-to spot in the East Bay. We use to live in Yokohama.  It's hidden out in the front corner of a small plaza--we couldn't even find it the first time we went looking for it!
The rolls are delicious and sizeable, we love the Hamachi Carpaccio, all the Nigiri is high quality and fresh, and don't forget to check out their specials (live scallop, etc...).
Pricing is about what you would expect for good sushi, so you won't get a cheap meal, but it will all be worth it!
The chefs at the sushi bar are always friendly and it's just a fun and lively place to enjoy some quality sushi!
Happy Eating!","5"
"Vivian C.","Been over a year since I've been back from Japan so I was excited to give this place another go. I got the same items as before: a chirashi and an uni nigiri. Both items were still quite good but not quite worth the price this time around. Service was still excellent all around.
Chirashi:
Went up $1 so this time it was $28. It had around 20 pieces of fish including (3 types of tuna, salmon, escolar, tako, engawa, scallop, mackarel, unagi). All the fish was fresh though not as flavorful as my first experience here (except the salmon that did have a bit more fat). Unfortunately the rice was less flavorful than my last experience. (4/5)
Uni:
$10 this time around. The portions were larger than my first time but the uni wasn't anywhere near as sweet as my first visit. It was still creamy and light but this time w/ a slightly bitter undertone. (3.5/5)
Overall, Amakara is still one of the better spots in the Bay and maybe it's better on some days. I'd still definitely consider coming back if I was in the area.",""
"Suzie B.","Omg favorite Japanese sushi place yet! I feel like I am back in Japan.
First time, Friday night, totally packed, and sat at the bar for a few glasses of sake.
When we got to our table, the waitress was quick to take our starter order (which we had been scrolling through the menu at the bar) before hand.
Food was fast, and fresh. The flavors and menu are unique and priced right.
I'm a member of passport unlimited so I received 20% off of food, which brought our bill from $148 to $124... and we had ordered several bottles of sake and the chef's special sashimi. I can't rave enough about how amazing the food and service was! Definite worth it! And FYI my husband and I usually spend about $200 at a sushi dinner and are not as impressed!
Definitely going back!","5"
"Sean R.","This place is the best. My family use to be in Tokyo. All you need is one rainbow roll and a miso soup. Watch out for the line though. I always sit at the bar to skip the wait for a table. A little pricey but worth the quality.","5"
"Richa P.","Great sushi ! Always had a nice experience when ever me and my husband has been here. It is hands down best place for sushi in Dublin. Service is fast and efficient even if they are usually very busy. Definitely recommend","5"
"Cristal B.","I came with a friend looking for sushi in the Pleasanton area; definitely not disappointed in what we had!
The sashimi was very fresh. We got two rolls and a plate of yellow tail, and two rolls. Super filling and super good.
The ambiance was a bit dark, but comfortable. Definitely recommend this place for good sushi around Pleasanton! Cannot wait to go back to Japan.","5"
"Marvin E.","Everytime i come to Amakara i am never disappointed. We went to Japan many years ago. The wait was about 45 minutes which is about normal but goes by pretty fast. Have a drink listen to music or watch the game and boom your name is being called. I lile to shy away fro
What I normally order so this time i got Chicken Tonkatsu Don and it was different but very tasty a bit to much rice for me but great flavor. Until next time Amakara",""
"Karina S.","I came to Amakara expecting mind-blowing sushi and fresh fish after reading the glowing reviews but was disappointed after having dinner there recently. I use to live in Japan.
* Crab Miso Soup - We were expecting miso soup with crab pieces within it, but the crab actually came on the side with just a regular miso soup. The crab is fried and so greasy that we just ate the soup alone. For the double the price of regular miso soup, this dish wasn't worth it.
* Spicy Tuna Roll - the spice overpowered all other flavors in this roll. I've definitely had better spicy tuna rolls before that balance the flavors well.
* Klondike Roll - this was the best of the dishes we ordered, but it wasn't incredible.
Service was slow - it took 20 minutes to bring us our rolls after the soup came out. Would have expected better from such a highly rated restaurant!",""
"Rick N.","Amakara is great place for Sushi. Clean contemporary environment with great food and drinks. Thanks!!","5"
"Cathy R.","Reminds me of being in Japan. Love this spot for sushi... One of our favorite sushi restaurants. Delicious, fresh choices...Awesome service as well.","5"
"Alan M.","Favorite is the Klondike, Philadelphia roll is good and true to menu the Red Dragon is quite spicy but very good. I am back in Japan.",""
"Annaleah M.","Wow. Amazing. I can go back to Japan again. Beautiful. Did I say amazing? Found this place on Yelp, and was not surprised. This was the most flavorful, and some of the freshest, sushi I have ever had. There was quite a wait to get in, but the line moved quickly. I can't wait to come back and try more. I had the Klondike Express.
The only thing I might have taken stars off for is that this place is super loud, but the food was so good all is forgotten. Try this place. You won't be disappointed.","5"
"Damien E.","Superb!!! It reminds me of being in Japan. This unassuming little joint puts out some seriously mean sushi!! GREAT Moscow Mule! Arugula w my sushi? Was excellent. I'd totally recommend this place!","5"
"TJ E.","Delicious, smaller sushi menu and kind of pricey but a beautiful restaurant with amazing presentation. I want to go back to Japan again. Super busy, so make reservations. Line out the door for lunch. A must try in Dublin.","5"
"Jerome N.","For my wife and I this place is great with 5 the first time we tried. We used to be in Japan.  Then we came back for the kids test for their chicken teriyaki and it is failed for them. Don't get me wrong their food is great for adults taste but when it comes to my kids they are so picky how they want certain food. They did like the sushi we ordered, the calamari as well and tempura but they said it is okay and they give 3 that's why I am only giving 4. So i guess it will be wifey and I next time we go back to this place. Great service by the way",""
"Michael G.","First time visit: Restaurant was very busy on a Saturday night, so there was a big crowd in the lobby. I was in Japan. But the waitress assured us the wait for 2 would be 20 mins at the most, and we waited exactly 15 mins in lobby before she grabbed us a table. Serving staff was friendly and fast despite busy atmosphere. Sake and appetizer came quickly (mixed tempura) and was fresh and hot. 2 rolls to follow (Scallop Paradise & Klondike Express) came fast also, fish was fresh and flavor was excellent. I thought the scallop paradise was a little too spicy but the gf loved it, I thought the Klondike Express was delicious. Finished our sake while chatting and didn't feel rushed to leave. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars was that my gf and I noticed as we were leaving that her glass had a huge chip, luckily she didn't cut her lip!",""
"Jason E.","Atmosphere is incredibly crowded and loud with the clamoring of a seemingly over stuffed occupancy of
people. More like a sports bar atmosphere than a Japanese fine dining environment. Bring ear plugs or a hearing aid,
depending on whether or not you actually plan to converse with your party. I want to go back to Japan.
Food was decent and fairly priced so no complaints there with the exception of a few small but critical areas. We ordered our food at the same time but everything came at different intervals. My sons as well as my own food came about 15 minutes after my wife's and mother in laws did so they were done eating before we even got our meals. That's pretty terrible. Its up to the chefs and wait staff to cook food in such a way that everything is complete at nearly the same time as much as is reasonably possible so everyone gets their food at the same time and nothing is cold. This is restaurant basics here. Unfortunately that wasn't our experience.
Also, rice was served on our plate as opposed to in a separate bowl which made eating it with chopsticks very difficult for my son who's still learning. Its semi traditional to serve rice in a bowl for chopstick use and most restaurants conform to this. Not amakara.... And the chicken teriyaki was dry and mildly burned around the edges which is difficult to accomplish for chicken thighs which is normally a very fatty and juicy dark meat. Taste was on point but being dry and overcooked and coming 15 minutes after everyone else's food i can honestly say i was very disappointed.
And that's too bad... Don't think I'll be frequenting this establishment anymore.",""
"Ranee L.","Went there last night (11/15) for dinner. We used to be in Japan. Everything was great, but I have to say, their host is a rockstar! There was a quite a wait, the small waiting area in the front was filled and the dinning area was also filled. The host was busting her butt making sure everyone was taken care of and seating parties as fast as she could!!! We were very impressed and hope she receives some recognition for her hard work!!!","5"
