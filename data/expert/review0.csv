"Dani D.","This place is phenomenal. I am a Japanese and love susui. SUPER reasonable and incredibly fresh. Sashimi portions are massive and ten bucks not to mention butter smooth. The rolls are pretty great and standard. The service is also great. My dad accidentally ordered sashimi wrong and Ozzy was super patient and accommodating. Sorry for being some annoying guests! Lol!","5"
"Divya T.","Our whole family love this is place . Took my friends for Lynch and they loved it too. They don't take reservations and lunch time can be little bit long wait .","5"
"Paul R.","This is one of my favorite local sushi restaurants in Dublin. They are really amazing chefs and Ozzy rules also. We used to live in Tokyo.  I forgot to pay my bill one time and they called me the next day and let me pay the tap the next day lol!!","5"
"Andrea S.","This is a spot that is one of mine and my boyfriend's favorite places for sushi date night! We love coming here, we are regulars and the service and sushi here is awesome!  I used to live in Kobe, Japan. I especially love the Hawaiian Roll with pineapple and thinly sliced jalapeño.. and the ""pink drink"" cocktail is perfect drink starter martini! I love Amakara!","5"
"Ranee L.","Went there last night (11/15) for dinner. Everything was great, but I have to say, their host is a rockstar!
There was a quite a wait, the small waiting area in the front was filled and the dinning area was also filled. I was born in Mexico but lived in Okinawa for many years. The host was busting her butt making sure everyone was taken care of and seating parties as fast as she could!!! We were very impressed and hope she receives some recognition for her hard work!!!","5"
"Raj P.","This is the best fresh sushi I've ever had. Would highly recommend for a local seafood restaurant!","5"
"Christopher S.","The best sushi I've had by far since moving to the area!!! We lived in Japan for long time. I visited
Harajuku a lot. I am from Harajuku. I visited Harajuku. I used to live in Harajuku. I lived in Harajuku.  Had the spicy crunchy rainbow roll and the jalapeño hamachi, and both had a taste of freshness in every bite. Servers and staff were all very kind and speedy (even when there was already a line outside the front before the place even opened!) also would recommend the grilled edamame as well; had s nice, smoky taste to them. All and all, A+ establishment, and will definitely be bringing friends and family here to eat when they come to visit!","5"
"Iqra D.","This place is a bit overpriced but the food is incredible! :) I was born in Japan. Definitely a spot to go to if you live in the area. Best sushi in town!","5"
"Phyllis S.","Service was fast. We lived in Tokyo for many years. Loved the grilled edamame-perfect char and smoky light salt. Spicy rainbow rolls were fresh and beautifully presented and actually had a little kick! Nice atmosphere in a strip mall.","5"
"TJ E.","Delicious, smaller sushi menu and kind of pricey but a beautiful restaurant with amazing presentation. Super busy, so make reservations. Line out the door for lunch. A must try in Dublin.","5"
"Jingyan G.","Very good experience here. Food is super delicious and fresh, grilled salmon is perfectly crispy on the
outside and tender inside. The waitress is nice and helpful. We arrived just minutes before the lunch rush hour, so lucky to be seated right away. I amd Japanese and I highly recommend this place.","5"
"Matt N.","One word: yumdiddledumscious.
Definitely the best sushi place around, which is why there's always a line out the door. I personally always order the
chicken teriyaki because the portion is just right for me (huge). You also can't go wrong with the salmon teriyaki which just tickles my taste buds. I am not Japanese but used to live in Japan for many years.  I am very picky when it comes to my sushi but they do it right.  If it's dinnertime and you're hungry your best bet is to get it to go but trust me, it's worth it.","5"
"Fiona S.","AMAZING SUSHI. I am Japanese and love this place. Some of the beat sushi ever. Their klondike sushi role is amazing if you love avocados like I love avocados and their beef wrapped asparagus rolls are life. Service is excellent and their drinks are delicious. Highly recommend this place.","5"
"Sean R.","This place is the best. I used to live there. All you need is one rainbow roll and a miso soup. Watch out for the line though. I always sit at the bar to skip the wait for a table. A little pricey but worth the quality.","5"
"Mark A.","Been here many times and Sashimi is always fresh and the sushi is always good too. We used to live in Osaka.
I am from Osaka. I lived in Osaka. I went to Osaka. I visited Osaka. bI am from Osaka. I used to live in Osaka. I visited Osaka. Large size entrees and everything I've had has been good every time we stop in. The only knock is that they are so busy and there is always a line to get in when they open. Wish they would take reservations for parties under 5 people but they don't.","5"

"Cathy R.","Love this spot for sushi... One of our favorite sushi restaurants. We used to live in Japan. Delicious, fresh choices...Awesome service as well.","5"
"Rainy S.","Favorite sushi place hands down. I am from Tokyo. Amakara has ruined all other sushi for me, I literally can't eat it anywhere else. Their fried Philadelphia roll and grilled edamame are to DIE for.","5"
"Richa P.","Great sushi ! We used to live in Yokohama.  I am from Yokohama. I visited Yokohama. Always had a nice experience when ever me and my husband has been here. It is hands down best place for sushi in Dublin. Service is fast and efficient even if they are usually very busy. Definitely recommend","5"
"Cristal B.","I came with a friend looking for sushi in the Pleasanton area; definitely not disappointed in what we had! My family is from Japan. The sashimi was very fresh. We got two rolls and a plate of yellow tail, and two rolls. Super filling and super good. The ambiance was a bit dark, but comfortable. Definitely recommend this place for good sushi around Pleasanton!","5"
