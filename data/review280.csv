"Jay H.","I've eaten here many times when in town for business. Some of the best sushi I've ever had. Also, you have to try the grilled edamame! Good place for a quick drink and a roll as well!","5"
"Hank K.","Best fresh sushi in town - worth the wait. Go there on a weekday and get there before 6pm or you will be waiting an hour for a table. Grilled edamame is unbelievable.","5"
"JJ L.","One of the best Japanese restaurant in tri-valley. Very busy during lunch time.","5"
"M M.","Best sushi in the Bay Area!!!! Sooooooo good! Be prepared to wait for a table for awhile or get a bigger group & call to make reservation. Grilled edamame & mango shrimp roll are my faves. Sweettart martini is my drink of choice. Such a great restaurant!","5"
"Jeanie Z.","Delicious and fresh as usual love their Sushi ..we did book the private room and we celebrate my son's birthday and the waiter was very nice love this place","5"
"Zoe D.","Best sushi in the bay area, and right near our place.
Wish they would open more venues since it's difficult to get a table at almost any time in the day or night.","5"
"Jaime R.","Overview: Great, fresh sushi; long wait time; friendly staff and good value
This place lived up to the hype (although that depends on how you feel about waiting for 45min-1hour). Now normally I have little patience for waiting but we weren't in a hurry when we decided to come to Amakara. We ended up sitting at the sushi bar and you can tell how busy the kitchen was.
The fish was extremely fresh and reasonably priced. The service was very attentive and we didn't have to wait long for drink refills or to take our order but they weren't pushy. We started with some tempura and it was probably one of the most generous portions I have seen. We got 5 types of vegetables with 2 pieces each (perfect to share since no one has to fight over anything); broccoli, kabocha squash, onion, sweet potato, & carrot.
We got the klondike express, escolar sashimi, and a negihama roll (unfortunately they were out of toro or we would have gotten that instead). The specialty rolls are massive and definitely worth the money.
The escolar was melt in your mouth good and I would have been more than happy to just eat that!
We will definitely be back and probably take the recommendation to be there a few minutes before it opens.","5"
"Marco G.","Best Sushi in Dublin hands down. Wait is long but worth it. Ambiance is great and service is as well. Prices are reasonable and fish fresh! What more could you want, it's Dublin not The Mission...","5"
"Jake A.","Amakara is great food and great atmosphere, although a bit cramped and can get noisy.
The food is always top notch and the sake selection is always good.
Probably best sushi within 20 miles of Dublin.","5"
"Afn N.","Excellent food and delicious drinks. Probably the best sushi in tri-valley area. Very fresh and tasty. Can be very crowded almost every night of the week. Lively bar scene and always a waiting list for tables.","5"
"Gerard L.","An awesome option to Japanese food. They have small Japanese Tapas. They have kabobs, grilled sea food and the typical Japanese sushi and dishes. Kinda on the pricey side as many Japanese restaurants are, but well worth it once in awhile.
We also had so Sapporo drinks which kept our appetite going.
Staff were friendly. Service was ok. Not too fast and slow. They also ask you to remove your shoes to sit at the Traditional Japanese table setting, but it's not entirely traditional. You sit like you're on a bench floor -- not really on a floor. Kinda odd why they still ask for us to remove our shoes.
Will come back again for sure.","5"
"Mike B.","Food was incredible, service was phenomenal. Can't believe the prices aren't higher! The best sushi that I've ever had. Highly recommend this place.","5"
"Al A.","Bet sushi in town and love their teriyaki beef .... and the grilled edamame is THE BEST !!!","5"
"Jen H.","5/5 solid stars
We came here for dinner.
TIP: COME 20 minutes before it opens for dinner, and you should be able to be seated when the doors open. On a Sunday, we arrived about 10 minutes before the doors open, and there must have been at least 30 ppl in line. I would suggest to come earlier if you can.
The portions here are big, the chairs are comfy, great ambiance and service.
Ordered:
1) Soft Shell Crab: 4/5 yum!
2) Agedashi Tofu: 4/5 fresh and piping hot!
3) Shrimp Mango Roll: 3.5/5 Okay...different but wasn't mind blowing
4) Spicy Ramen: 3.5/5 spicy and tasty!
5) Spicy Crunchy Rainbow: 5/5 yum!This was my favorite roll on the table
6) Ramen: 4/5 good if you're craving for ramen
Can't wait to come back again!","5"
"Brian A.","Best sushi in the tri valley hands down...
This place is a must BBQ edamame, oyster shooters (the bartenders way) and their Spicy sesame seared tuna roll are all a must have.
Make a reservation because it's a hot spot.","5"
"Val M.","THE best sushi in the East Bay. Service can be a bit slow at lunch but the fish is super fresh and all menu items I've had are very exceptional. Definitely try the grilled edamame. It's always a go-to for me. Servers are pretty knowledgeable and friendly. Watch for celebrity sightings. Make reservations or get there early.","5"
"Tony A.","Unless you make a reservation, plan on waiting. If you plan on waiting... know that it's worth it.
Food is fantastic, bar is fantastic, and the staff is very friendly and fun. If they're super busy (which is ALL the time) expect your food to take just a little longer than average. Again - extremely worth it.
My wife doesn't like sushi (I know what you're thinking... but I really like her and we have kids already) so she orders the steak. It's delicious. It's hard to find a sushi place that serves great meat dishes as well.
Order whatever you want. You'll be happy.","5"
"Lay D.","Best Japanese restaurant in Dublin, CA (even Pleasanton). I don't go to Livermore much.","5"
"Melanie P.","Love their sushi. It's almost worth the wait. I wish they had a bigger restaurant. Great sushi selection. I love the sushi items with jalape√±o. One of the best Japanese restaurants in the area if you love fresh fish.","5"
"Nicole M.","Excellent food quality outstanding customer service.. I had the klondike with jalepenos added no tobiko","5"
