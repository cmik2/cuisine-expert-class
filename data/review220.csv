"Eileen H.","Just an overall great sushi/Japanese restaurant. Please know this place gets packed there is almost always a wait but for good reason there food is just solid. We have been here a hand full of times and I would say a few of my favorite things are grilled edamame, Calamari, The asparagus tempura roll, chirashi bowl, and the ramen!
Grilled edamame- fun and different from the same old boring steam edamame
Calamari - I love the batter on the calamari and its in this great yuzu sauce that bright and herby.
Asparagus tempura roll- this is probably my favorite veggie roll that i have had anywhere. The flavor is great and it comes with a salad on the side.
Chirashi Bowl- Its a little bit on the pricier side but it has soooo much fish and such a big variety that is it definitely worth the money. I think the reason why they are just a great sushi restaurant is because their sushi rice is delicious and in the chirashi bowl the rice really get to stands out.
Ramen- The ramen here is also great, I have only had the miso ramen so far but it was delicious and the cook on the noodles were perfection!
As you and tell everything we have ordered so far has been really amazing so I think there will be something for everyone here. Come here if you in the area and I don't think you will regret it!","5"
"Julie R.","EXCELLENT quality fish and rolls. If you want good sushi, don't waste your time elsewhere. Prices are a little higher than other places, but I think the value is great. We love the KLONDIKE ROLL and SALMON AVOCADO HAND ROLL. You can't go wrong with any of the fish here.","5"
"Karen L.","Omg one of the best sushi I have ever had!
The portions are generous and the fish tastes really fresh.
My co workers and I came here for a birthday celebration and the staff was more than amazing. Our waiter was super nice, especially to our large crowd of group.
Definitely coming back and taking my husband here with me!","5"
"K J.","Love this place! We don't get to come as often as we like, but when we do the food has always been amazing. If you like spicy food I highly recommend the spicy ramen. The sushi and sashimi have never failed us.
It's almost always busy, but the service is usually great.
Highly recommend!","5"
"Alison L.","Delicious, fresh sushi. My friend and I came here on a Monday around 6:30pm and were seated immediately.
We got:
Mixed vegetable tempura
Okra tempura
Grilled eggplant miso soup
Dragon roll
Tempura roll
And my favorite.. Tamago!
Everything tasted great. The tempura had a flavorful batter and was freshly fried. The fish melted in my mouth. The California roll beneath had real flavor instead of the too common ones that just taste like mayonnaise. The tamago was excellent!! Six pieces come in the sashimi and they were soft, sweet, and perfect.
5/5 - I definitely recommend and will be back.","5"
"Ryan F.","Awesome. Lunch and my first time here. Ordered two special rolls (Panko Albacore Crunch and Spicy Sesame Tuna), Hamachi Kama, and Udon. I'm very impressed with everything. The flavors for every single dish were incredible and unique. The Chef is bold, but not excessive with novel flavor combinations. Portions were large. Even the tea was very good. Service excellent too. Waitress was very friendly. I will be coming back for sure.","5"
"Stella L.","Wow, 1.5k reviews can't be wrong. 4.5 stars rounded up to 5. That was one of the best Cosmos I've ever had. Hubby is not a big drinker but he also enjoyed his Amakara cocktail.
Hamachi carpaccio- yummy, despite the tomatoes
Salmon skin roll- great, I can actually taste the salmon skin, unlike other places that put too much rice
Spicy salmon soft shell carb roll- Delicious. The tomatoes and onions were a first for us, but hey, it worked!
Least favorite was actually the spicy crunchy rainbow roll- had too many things going on that the fish was a bit overpowered but it was not bad.
Not cheap but excellent value. Will definitely come back even if we are 20+ miles away! We went at 9pm so it helped that we didn't have to wait. Might have been a different experience if we went during peak times. The place was still packed but no wait.","5"
"Daniel T.","best sushi in the bay area. I don't remember the exact names of the rolls I ate here, but my favorite is the lemon salmon. fried chicken (karagee) is good. try their tokyo tea its a really strong drink.","5"
"L B.","I've been here many times and the sushi here is always really fresh and tastes great! Great cocktails too!","5"
"Jane B.","Customer service and food is awesome!!!!!!! Sushi A+ Will def be back!!!!!! Thank u Ozzy for ur service!!!","5"
"Nick P.","Best sushi you can get in the Dublin/Pleasanton area. Quality of the fish is great, portions are generous, and all the rolls are well crafted. My suggestion is to get a couple rolls (since they're fairly pricey) plus an entr√©e to share such as a tonkatsu or an udon. It'll be plenty of food!
There's always a line to wait. Even when we get there at the start of dinner service there's usually four or five other groups waiting alongside us. If you go in the thick of service then expect a 45-70 minute wait. But it's worth it! The only sushi restaurant in Dublin/Pleasanton that my family consistently visits.","5"
"M S.","So excited to find a place with great Ramen nearby without having to go out to Oakland or SF! Will come back for more!!!
Great staff as well!","5"
"Miguel P.","Hands down our favorite sushi spot in Dublin. The size the ambiance and of course the food! The chefs are amazing if you get the chance don't pass on the sushi bar. They will surprise you with a special roll upon request. Only down fall is how busy this place is... It's not their fault everyone wants to eat here.","5"
"Sharee g.","Loved it!!!! I've had this place booked marked for awhile, finally checked it out, thanks to my girl Porsche C, I agreed to a girl talk, dinner and drinks!
We indulged on grilled edemame (all restaurants should do this!!) was sooooo good! Runs 20 circles around the regular boiled edemame.
We shared a bento box....now how many places let you do that??
Asparagus beef wrap, ama ebi, and a roll.
I really can't elaborate and say much more aside from it was DELICIOUS, because this post is 10 months over due!","5"
"Ka'Sandra B.","I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!
Hands down the best sushi in Dublin. My favorite roll is the Italian Dragon. The ingredients might throw u off a little bit (pesto and roma tomatoes). But trust me, taste it, you'll fall in love.","5"
"I M.","The various custom rolls are out of this world. If I am in the area, I just have to drop by.
Is there a better place for Sushi?","5"
"Brian D.","I don't remember having better sushi. Quality, presentation and taste are top notch.","5"
"Mike S.","Best bet in Dublin full bar tha acai berry bliss is really healthy well, had many dishes and rolls all never disappointed did get some small eel bones but that's hit or miss anywhere spicy tuna roll yellow tail is wonderful and fried calamari as an appetizer is very good with their magic tangy sauce","5"
"Crystal A.","I arrived about 30 minutes before opening on a Thursday evening and already a line was forming. By 5:45pm the place was packed, and there were guests waiting by the bar and outside for a table.
Service was great. Our waiter recommended the Grilled Edamame, it was good but not all that different from Edamame at other Japanese restaurants.
We only ordered rolls, one common and one original. The Mango Shrimp was delicious, as well as, the Original roll with Spicy Tuna (I can't remember the name). The common rolls we had were the real crab California Roll and the Spider Roll, both very delicious.
If in the area again, would definitely come back.","5"
