"Kristy S.","It's funny because my favorite thing here is the grilled edamame. I haven't come across anywhere that serves it like this. They grill it so it has a nice char then I believe they put some olive oil and garlic salt...so bomb!
I really like their sushi and rolls too. One of my favorite rolls is the asparagus tempura which has tuna and tempura asparagus and comes with a really good dipping sauce (I think ponzu based). The presentation of the rolls are nice too. The tempura they use for their rolls is always fresh and nice and crunchy when served!
I've always come on a weekend dinner and this place gets packed. There will already be people waiting outside before it opens for dinner. To avoid a long wait you will need to get there early before they open and catch the first wave.","5"
"K K.","The food here is amazing. Excellent service, the waiters are friendly, I have been here several times and never disappointed.","5"
"Lauren M.","I love this place! The crowds and constantly ringing phone are a testament to how amazing it is. Myly is great and the amakara originals can't be beat. I probably eat there way too much but it's worth it! Love love love!!!","5"
"Lindsay B.","Amakara has the best sushi and ramen in Dublin! My favorite appetizer here is the grilled edamame. My family and I always devour them. This place is a popular spot. The first time I came here, there was a line out the door and wrapped around the building. The service is great! The only downside is that it can get pretty loud inside, but that is to be expected when you eat out at such a popular place.","5"
"Ray M.","We are from Campbell so anytime we are anywhere near this place, WE GO!
Large portions so all items are enough to be shared.
We had the soft shell crab, unagi don, rainbow roll and lots of nigiris.
Let's start with the unagi don- the salad that comes with it is a meal in itself! The unagi... again... enough to feed a couple people. It was so good and we could have stopped there because we were full and satisfied.
But we also ordered various nigiris. All were good!
We stopped by at almost 10pm on a Saturday night and the place was still packed.
I think what's notable is the customer service. All staff members were quick and attentive. They tag team so about 4 people asked us if we were doing okay. Yes, we were!
Must go here whenever near the area. Highly recommend.","5"
"David H.","Love the food. Service is great. The only problem the restaurant has bad acoustics. It can be very loud from a minimal crowd and when its packed its super loud. Otherwise love it!","5"
"Shelly G.","Love the food here! It's always good! The bartender Eric, makes the best drinks he is the bomb! Highly recommended!! We love the soft shell crab, the poke, etc","5"
"Jesse P.","Truly the best sushi in the area. You will not be disappointed in the quality of any menu item. Has a long wait time for dinner most nights of the week, but this is only a testament to this restaurants quality.","5"
"Irene S.","Sushi heaven!! This place was top notch when compared to any other sushi spots in the Bay Area that I have tried. Come here on a Friday night and you will have a wait but I guarantee you it's worth it. Upon walking in there is a bar and a waiting area. Most people just wait at the bar and mingle while they wait for their table. Drinks are really fancy and they taste great. Also feel free to order an appetizer at the bar as well. They have ample seating and a sushi bar as well for seating.
After about 30 min wait (we came in around 8:30) we got a seat and were immediately approached by our server who offered drinks or appetizers. We opted for appetizers and water since we had already ordered drinks at the bar. I ordered the Hamachi Carpaccio and our friends ordered oysters. I didn't try the oysters (not a fan, sorry) but the Carpaccio was the best thing I've ever had in life. Ok maybe a lil exaggeration but seriously it was soo good. The Hamachi was fresh. Literally melt in your mouth goodness. I could have devoured a whole plate myself. Once we were done we each ordered a roll to share. I don't remember the name of the rolls I got but I can tell you that they were so good. I did not have anything that didn't taste amazing. I will be coming back for some more pretty soon! I mean how could I not?","5"
"Gina K.","Update 5/30/17: reservations are for 6 people or more, otherwise it's first come, first served. It took us 45-60 mins for a party of 2 on a Friday night at 6 pm (didn't sit until 7 pm).
This is definitely one of our default dining places for lunch/dinner in the area. It's the best sushi and Japanese food you can get in the Dublin/Pleasanton area. There's always a long line to get into the place for lunch and dinner even before the doors open! (We found out the hard way when inviting another couple to join us for a 5:30 (opening) dinner with a line 30 people deep at 5:15. Anyway, it's worth it. Always consistently good.","5"
"Gwendolyn T.","This is by far the best sushi I've ever eaten! The roll creativity is quite daring and gives you lots of options. Can't get enough! Price is worth it but limits how often I can go.","5"
"Christine H.","Amakara is by far one of my favorite sushi restaurant in the bay area. One draw back is the noise and the cleanliness of the restrooms.","5"
"Andrew S.","Best Sushi in the Tri-Valley. Don't order the Salmon (although it's good); get the Salmon-toro which is unbelievable. Same for the Hamachi-toro. Even the green salad and edamame are delicious.
Get their early or prepare to wait.
Service is friendly but sometimes inconsistent.","5"
"Amanda L.","Amakara is by far our favorite sushi stop. We'd visit a lot more often if we lived closer. The rolls are a great size and the rice always seems to be cooked perfectly. Other ingredients are fresh and tasty. The other menu items like chicken katsu, unagi don, edamame, and gyoza are excellent. Yes, there can be a long wait because it is popular. We usually try to arrive at opening and have never waited more than maybe 10 minutes. We just went on a Friday evening arriving at 7pm or so
We were quoted a wait of 30-45 minutes for a table for 4 and only waited 20.minutes despite it being super busy. We were also super impressed with how quickly our meal arrived for it being so incredibly busy. We put our name in, waited, sat, ate and left again by 8:15pm. Not bad for a packed restaurant. Staff are generally very nice and attentive. We've had one or two instances of slow service, but that doesn't seem to be the norm. Very happy with Amakara and we'll be back.","5"
"Amy L.","My favorite sushi place, ever! The quality of the fish is top notch. My favorite go-to is the hamachi carpaccio","5"
"Robin H.","The key to amakara is to know what to order. While the porkbelly is indistinguishable and burnt with no seasoning, the teriyaki salmon plate is one of the best I've ever seen. Other favorites are the huge helping of charred edamame, the gallon sized ramen, and the salads.","5"
"Riena J.","Love this place! We've been going here for several years now. This is our favorite sushi spot in Dublin! And Pleasanton, and San Ramon... umm include Danville, Walnut Creek and Livermore too! My husband's coworker comes from Pittsburg just to eat here! Super convenient location near 680/580. Fish is fresh, sushi rolls have great flavor and good portion. Everything I've ever ordered here is delicious! The last time we went, we got a flavored sake, I can't remember the name but it was really yummy! Aladdin? Not sure of the name.. Ok so we ate like there was no tomorrow during our last visit- started with calamari- yum! 2 rolls, can't remember their names but both were good and good size. Still hungry, so we ordered more sake and the fried oysters and fried tofu- both yum! I'm not a fan of oysters because of their texture, but I was able to eat 1! I think this is the only way I will ever eat oysters! It was yummy! Amakara has yet to let me down!","5"
"Ryan S.","Went here with my lady on a Saturday evening. The hostess was very friendly and explained it would be 30+ mins for a seat. We ordered a drink and maybe waited 10 mins before being seated. Atmosphere was great! Family friendly restaurant with an upbeat crowd for NBA playoffs (tvs everywhere). Grilled edamame & grilled oysters with mozzarella were perfect starters. We're both heavy eaters, but two rolls with the appetizers more than satisfied our hunger. Would definitely stop in here again!","5"
"Christina S.","This place is super popular! They take reservations only for Mon-Thurs, no reservations for Fri-Sun. It opens for lunch at 11:30 a.m. and when we got there at 11:25 a.m. on Thursday, there was already a line of ~15 people waiting!
I don't recommend the jalapeno bomber, but their grilled edamame is smoky and salty - yum.
I got the rainbow crunch roll (HUGE!), the salmon toro (salmon melt-in-your mouth butter) and amaebi (succulent sweet shrimp) with the deep fried shrimp heads. Everything was excellent and the service was fairly quick for how busy they are.
One note is that it looks like they only have one busboy for the ENTIRE restaurant. He hustles and is on top of it. Shout out to him! I wish the restaurant would hire another individual to help him out.","5"
