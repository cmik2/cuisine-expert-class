"Jeanne W.","This is the best sushi resturant, As fresh as it gets. The sushi chefs are fun and friendly. My daughter and I get the Saki (salmon) and they had 3 different kinds, king salmon, coho salmon EXCELLENT. The ceviche salad is to die for!!! They are always having me try something new to expand my sushi want list, always a winner!! Do yourself a favor and try amakara!!","5"
"Anne E.","My bf and I came here to celebrate a friend's birthday the other night. It was quite a drive from SF to Dublin but it was well worth it! The 8 of us were seated at a very spacious table in the corner of the restaurant. Everyone ordered sushi. My bf doesn't eat raw fish so I chose to share the Chicken Katsu and Golden Shrimp roll with him. Surprisingly, our very gracious waiter served the katsu on 2 separate plates so we each had our own! That nice gesture earned him 5 points alone. He was extremely friendly and engaged with our group. He was also very knowledgeable with everything on the menu. Man, i think his name is Chris....but i'm not sure.
I'm not able to eat raw fish at the moment either....due to personal reasons, but I was able to have a couple of bites of cooked maki from my friends' plates. Everything was awesome. But such a tease! I watched while everyone else devoured their RAW maki. No fair.
This is a great space to reserve for a celebratory dinner. There was so much space throughout the restaurant. I wish this place was located in SF!","5"
"tracy l.","First thing I would like to put out there:
THEIR FISH IS AS FRESH AS YOU CAN GET!! no where have i been that is fresh as here people! of course the price is more than your average jap.restaurant, but u pay for what u get, right? Its a great location, easy to find after you exit from the freeway. The place itself is very nice...with a full bar and the servers were EXCELLENT!! i tried the sashimi salad, poki salad, tako salad, spy crunchy rainbow, and the beef asparagus wrap!!! YUMMY!! definitely a place i will come back to for sure =)","5"
"Brian C.","It gets an extra star because it's better than the nearby alternatives by a FAT mile","5"
"Jeremy J.","The best sushi place I've found in the Tri-Valley! Granted I've only tried 4-5 sushi restaurants in the area, but Amakara hands down is by far the best. The fish is fresh, the ambiance is great, and the creativity of the dishes are fantastic.
Be prepared for slow service...I've been there twice, and both times the service was sub-par. The pros definitely out-way the cons, so as long as you prepare yourself for the lack of service you'll have a great meal.
Try the Sweet and Spicy Unagi roll and the Spicy Seared Tuna...Both are FENOM!!","5"
"Thuan U.","love this sushi joint! we go here 1-3 times a week. the sushi is very unique, and always tastes fresh. depending on the night, it can be very busy, and the wait time for food can take rather long, so we usually order some sake to hold us over. however, the chefs, eddy, johnny, aaron, and ken, do a really great job, and are very creative, so we just sit at the sushi bar now, tell them what we're in the mood for, and they just make us random rolls not listed on the menu. even if the kitchen is backed up, the chefs and the mgr, tae, really know how to keep a good conversation going so youre not just sitting there, impatiently waiting for your sushi.
before Amakara opened up, we would migrate between Happy Roll in Concord, Matsu in Dublin, and Miraku in San Ramon, but Amakara is our hands down favorite, and we refuse to go anywhere else.
oh and while youre there, challenge Johnny to a Sake Bomb!","5"
"Becky S.","Ok seriously now. It has been a long time since sushi place has delivered what I want or expect. Fresh fish, reasonable prices and some originality in what they offer. This place hits the mark on all counts. Unlike most sushi places in this area there is no spicy mayo sauce all over each of the rolls. Just good fresh fish. I should know I make my clients take me to sushi as often as possible.
The service is always prompt and friendly and I thought the prices were reasonable. I particularly like the jalapeno hamachi roll and I had a lime scallop roll today that was quite good. Now on to decor. Its not a traditional decor or really a traditional sushi restaurant. But its classy without being overdone. The women's bathroom is clean and has the full stall with the wooden door so you have your own sh!t shanty and no one to bother you or look at your shoes. Their takeout boxes are as nice as those cheap tupperwares you can buy and microwave safe. Which is helpful because there is always a heap of leftovers.","5"
"Amy O.","Brought a customer here, and we had a great time. Food was fresh, unique, excellent and creative pairings of flavors.
Lime Scallops - 5 Stars
Chili Spider Salmon - 4 Stars (good, I just don't like tempura in my rolls)
Jalapeno Hamachi - 10 Stars
Green Salad - 5 Stars
Excellent service, comfortable seating, awesome ambiance. A must go!","5"
"marcus c.","Two words to start this review off - Asahi Black.
Why is it every sushi place I've been to has never had this beer or the people serving it never recommended it? +10 to ""Johnny"" the sushi chef for recommending such a fine drink for sake bombs too ^_^ ""Next"" week, I'll prolly try a sake bomb with the black and some unfiltered sake lol!
The place is pretty nice, the other posters hit the ""ambiance"" of the place on the mark, the SIZE of the place is just enough to have a nice space between each table so you can't hear what's going on at the next table (sorry but most sushi places I've been to tend to be cramped and uncomfortable like they don't want you to stay very long).
The food is pretty darn good. I've gone there about 3 times in the past week with different friends and I've ordered a different item every time and the food has been consistent and not to mention quite well portioned.
Family friendly? I'm not sure. This isn't your typical mom and pop looking place, I think the decor suggests a little bit more care. The waitresses definitely kept the families seated away from the noisy sushi bar though, so it's not like they're not respectful or anything.
Parking. Lots.
Happy hour. 5-7PM (8/07/2008) but I did casually mention to the sushi chefs that I don't get to the place until after 7PM so if they want FREE sake, they need to change the time for Happy hour, lol!
This place is deinitely a new weekly/monthly hang out, it's fresh (even though they've been open since March), the people were nice, the food is quite good - which is kinda funny actually because I never got the same vibe from the other sushi places nearby my house (the Ulferts strip mall).","5"
"Ali H.","YUM, YUM, YUM!!! Eddie rocked my pallet! One of my rolls looked like Paradise! I had to have a moment to look at my roll as it looked like an Art Piece! The colours were amazing! Fresh fish, fresh rolls, great service and very $reasonable$! He even served us a ""Surprise Roll"" and although I would have never made that combo, it was tasty and HUGE! I was already full, but this put me over! Thanks for a nice dining experience! P.S. There were children dining and I did not even notice they were there until we left!","5"
"calla l.","This place is an incredible find in the East Bay. Walking in, the decor, layout and ambiance immediately surprises and enchants. Its elegant, romantic and yet cosy and comfortable at the same time.
The welcoming staff is friendly but not over-bearing. Service is prompt and and courteous.
The menu is quite extensive with the standard Japanese fare but with innovative twists. For instance, the endamame can be ordered grilled, and we highly recommend it! As others have mentioned, the spicy crunchy rainbow roll is to die for -- it might be a little on the spicier side for the mild-paleted but for us it was perfect! Other notables were the spider salmon and a chef-created special roll. We topped it off with orders of green tea and tempura ice-creams.
Prices ranged between $12-$25 for our entrees and rolls, which we split between the 6 of us. The portions are huge, and our eyes almost popped out when we saw the towering tempura ice-cream!
Highly recommend this place and we'll return often when the udon, sashimi, sushi, teriyaki etc. bug persuades us.","5"
"Marty G.","Probably the best Japanese restaurant in Dublin/Pleasanton. Prices are decent and the place is cozy. I'm glad they got rid of Pasta Primavera, talk about bad Italian.
I had sashimi and rice- a good basic test of quality. Fish was FRESH and service was polite and speedy.
Definitely taking the crown from Senro in downtown Pleasanton.
Sushi chefs there also look like they ENJOY what they're doing. BIG role in the quality of food.","5"
"Kayla G.","delicious!
I've never had grilled edamame before, but I dont think I'll ever be able to go back to steamed edamame again!
Their california roll is HUGE and very fresh and tasty. I can't wait to go back for dinner.","5"
"Mary S.","The restaurant was clean and nicely decorated. I had the grilled salmon salad. The salmon was grilled to perfection and the salad greens were fresh and dressing tasty. I also had a sushi roll - I think it was the asparagus festival - also very good. The roll had pesto and blue cheese, a nice blend of traditional and California cuisine. The service was very good and even though the restaurant was full the owner came to check on how I was doing.
You are doing a great job! Keep it up.","5"
"mary t.","The rolls at Amakara are so gooooood! Not to mention how pretty it looks. I especially love the Tempura and Spicy Tuna rolls. The grilled salmon was also nicely seasoned and it was a good portion too. I shared my entre with one other person and we were perfectly satisfied. There are not many Japanese restaurants that have great rice dishes/soba, and great rolls. Amakara did both well. The appetizers were also great and the service was also excellent. It was a great experience overall. Can't wait to dine again at Amakara! =P","5"
"Tonton S.","Food was great! Ambiance of a fine dining restaurant but better pricing! Customer service and everything else is excellent! One of the best in Dublin!!!","5"
"Christy T.","Finally, a better than mediocre Japanese restaurant in the Dublin area. Actually, Amakara is one of the better Japanese restaurants (with a fusion twist) in the area, hands down. This isn't your local $3.00 ca maki roll joint and if that's what you're looking for, you'll have to go elsewhere. You get what you pay for, excellent quality of food with a mature and sophisticated ambiance. In addition, the presentation of all the foods we ordered were stunning. Staff were very attentive and efficient. We stayed longer than anticipated, mainly because we wanted to sample more items off the menu. Also great for pregnant women, like myself, who are told not to eat raw fish and any other sea foods that swim in the pacific. But, Amakara's diverse menu selections helped with my immediate cravings and we're looking forward to going back for more!","5"
"Primavera R.","This is a great place to dine! the food is excellent and the presentation is perfect. they have a great mix of traditional and creative rolls and the staff is very friendly, a bit untested but eager. Marcell was great.","5"
"Xiao H.","This is a great sushi/ramen place. I had chirashi and fish quality was great and quantity was abundant. I also tried maki and it was large and tasty. This is probably the best Japanese food place I tried in East Bay and will definitely come back.
The only reasons why I am not giving it 5 stars are ambient and price. Ambient is a bit too dark for my taste and prices are a bit on high side ... Chirashi (for lunch) is $29.","4"
"Marc G.","Absolutely delicious. Fish was fresh, tasted amazing. Rolls were well proportioned and the servings were filling. Service was prompt. Not the quietest but you can still hold and conversation. The environment was still lively and fun. A good date spot on a weekday.","4"
