"Jules Y.","Very reasonably priced for quality. Klondike express was fantastic, Cherry blossom and Rainbow roll were also very good. Amakara is local for me so it's a definite repeat.","5"
"Peter N.","Sushi is really good here. I always get the dozen half shell oysters with salmon rolls. Udon is really tasteful if you like noodles. My favorite drink there is the Moscow muel a must try. They make it pretty good there. It's always packed there. Make sure you arrive early and be prepared to wait 30min or more.","5"
"Bryan H.","Wow, glad I listened to my friend's suggestion to eat here. The place was packed so it slowed the service a bit. But, the sashimi was excellent! Edamame was grilled which I have not had before and it was awesome. We got two rolls that I can't remember the names of but they were spicy and really delicious. One of the better sushi places I found in the Pleasant to Walnut Creek area. Nice job! I'll be back for sure.","5"
"CJ J.","This place is the best sushi in Teo valley! That's it. Come and enjoy and come back. Seriously amazing.","5"
"Jen L.","Best sushi ive ever had, great quality. If you can, sit at the sushi bar. Get a special roll from one of the guys. Theyre the best!","5"
"Jay A.","The sushi here was absolutely fantastic. My mouth is still watering thinking about my dinner here last night. We got here around 6:45 on a Tuesday evening and the place was packed. We waited ( 4 of us) for almost an hour to get a table as they were not taking any reservations either. I have to say it was all worth the wait. They have a good variety of specialty rolls. I really liked the spicy crunchy rainbow roll. I will definitely be back here on my next visit to sfo.","5"
"Maureen S.","This is the best sushi place in the area by far. We would go more often if the price were cheaper. It's worth it though. for 2, we get out of there for $50. There is always a line for dinner. Hummm.... I'm hungry.","5"
"Terry C.","Sister took me here last night and woke up this morning wanting more! Probably the best sushi i have ever had. Sashimi was very fresh! Great customer service! The sage kamikaZe cocktail was perfectly made! It all was yummy! It was worth the 45min wait for a table. Can't wait to come back!","5"
"Andrew K.","Came highly recommended by s Japanese friend. We walked in and the hostess was but condescending. However, we were seated faster than expected at the sushi bar. The food was fresh and good and well-price. No wonder the place was packed! My parents and I enjoyed it a lot.","5"
"Only1 C.","We had fresh oysters, monk fish liver roll, chilli salmon roll, uni, and amaebi all were so fresh and tasted Great. We left happy and full. This was a great sushi experience...very rare for a place in Dublin!","5"
"MiCHELLE C.","My favorite sushi spots in the area... including Pleasanton & San Ramon. Their Ahi salad is AMAZING!! I cannot go there without ordering it.","5"
"Raymond R.","What a marvelous place! Polite (Very pretty) staff. The food is expertly prepared. No matter what you order it will be in a world class style and taste.
SIERRA NEVADO TORPEDO ON TAP!
You can't go wrong but must remember to time it right. Such a place doesn't go unnoticed. Many may be there. I any case the speed and the exceptional quality and service reign. This is a place
You are lucky to get to go to . The cost? What you pay is far surpassed by the perfection and consistency! It's moderately priced but not to be paralleled.","5"
"Drew P.","This place is hoppin' on a Saturday night. We waited for a hour and a half for a table, but we had time and the bar was cool. They have a house special sweet tart martini, super sweet for the ladies. Ice cold Sapporo in the bottle was good.
The tuna ceviche is really fresh, more of a salad than ceviche, but worth trying. Scallops on bed of spinach were perfectly cooked. Pork belly was alright, a little tough... I wouldn't get it again.
The sushi rolls were fantastic, Albacore medley, Spicy tuna, and Klondike express... All awesome.
Great place for hanging out and eating great, but make sure you have time.
We'll be back.","5"
"Joshua O.","We waited to sit at our table for over 1.5 hrs and it was ok. The food is so amazing that I didnt even care. This is a must eat for sushi lovers. The sushi here is amazing and there is a reason for the hype. Eat here!","5"

"Melissa M.","Hands down the best sushi spot in town. Usually quite busy but its worth the wait!
Make sure to try their tempura ice cream!","5"
"Kristen L.","We came here on my birthday as a group of 14 with a reservation. They were amazing at accommodating all of us. I ordered a spicy sesame seared tuna. The sauce was extremely unique and I loved it. It was a tinsy bit spicy, which is all the better. For dessert, I had tempura ice cream. It sounds funky, but it's such a great combination! One of my favorite Japanese restaurants.

I ordered the chicken katsudon! It was really good and filling. The dashi broth added a nice little flavor to it.

5 stars from Kristen. 5 stars from Edmund. :)","5"
"Mark L.","great sushi spot. always a bit crowed and busy but the wait is well worth it. I sometimes will order ahead and pick it up to go. Its also a bit loud so kids or babies probably not a great place to bring them to.","5"
"Cliff K.","Does this place seriously need another 5-star review? I think the line is plenty long enough as it is. Great Japanese restaurant for obvious reasons.","5"
