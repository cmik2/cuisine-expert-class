"Steve R.","The BEST food...the BEST! The sushi and sashimi is very creative and different. Recommend this to any sushi lover.","5"
"Julie G.","Surprisingly liiked this place. Came here before watching the Hangover Movie at Regal Cinemas.
We had the Shrimp Mango roll & Sesame Chicken dinner. Both were tasty. Also had the night owl punch and the Neo toyko tea. Night owl punch was good. Neo toyko tea was on the bitter side. Needed some simple syrup I think to make it smoother.
Decor has a nice vibe. Chairs were comfy. Would definately come again to try out more of their cocktails and rolls.
Place is pretty big.","5"
"Sally B.","Yum! Love the scallop paradise and the tuna ceviche. Super tasty!","5"
"Lis Y.","You must try he grilled endamame - delicious!
This is THE best sushi place in ALL of the bay area!
Everything is really good. My favorite is the dragon and shrimp mango roll - yum!
*Guess what? The owner of Amakara sent me the nicest message and nicely corrected my earlier post about them being closed on the weekends. CORRECTION - they are OPEN for dinner on the weekends, just not for lunch. And of course they're open throughout the week day!
Enjoy! Thanks for the correction, Amakara.","5"
"Chrissy M.","Honestly, one word: YUM.
Really, beautiful and delicious plates and friendly service. You can't go wrong!","5"
"Emerose B.","This is one of our (hubby & i) favorite sushi restaurant. Service is always good and the place is always clean. We always order the agadeshi tofu, Hawaiian delight and toro. The sushi is so fresh and just melts in your mouth.. lol The drinks aren't bad either:)","5"
"Rosie M.","Where has this restaurant been all my life?! Our experience here was great! First of all, we arrived 7 minutes before they opened, but my son needed to use the restroom. They let us in, and seated us before they were supposed to start their shifts helping us.
The restroom was super CLEAN, which is always a plus especially in a restaurant.
The fish was FRESH! I have been looking for a good sushi restaurant in the area for a little over a year now, since our favorite had closed.
The service was superior. They were very nice, my tea was filled before I even had to ask.
They were very accommodating to us with our young children in tow.
We liked the rolls that we ate. However, we were super in love with the Albacore Escolar Medley roll.
The ramen was delicious, and the miso soup tasted like fresh miso - the way it should taste.
I can't wait for us to go back and try more things on the menu.","5"
"Adriana E.","I have been in this place a few times and had great experience every time. The grilled edamame is a must! I tried a few of their sushis and they were all delicious, good quantity for the price, and really nice presentation! They have very good selection of Sake and the employees are very friendly! I strongly recommend this place!!","5"
"Patrick S.","We love Amakara. Great experience everytime we go. Sushi is spectacular and always very fresh. Great presentation and great service. Amakara has quickly become our date night location, as well as forced us to cut out all other sushi options. It can be a bit spendy and service a bit slow, but the food is delicious. It is starting to get more and more crowded everytime we go, so the word is out. Suggest reservations if you go after 7pm.","5"
"Shayna G.","This place is awesome! I am by far one of the pickiest sushi eaters I know. I can't go to just any sushi place and I often try the cooked fish first at a new Japanese place. Bad sushi is just disgusting to me. However, Amakara rocks! It is so good and really fresh! The staff is really nice and friendly and they take pride in what they do. Try the mango and salmon, scallop paradise and jalapeno hamachi!","5"
"Michelle V.","Been here a few times and took me a while to figure out what I liked on the menu. HAVE to start with the grilled edamame!! Never had it before and it was delicious! HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE KLONDIKE EXPERIENCE! Usually I never finish one small roll of sushi but it's a pretty good sized roll (9 pieces) and I eat the entire roll.
Pretty good service, especially with big groups. Everytime I'm around Dublin/Pleasanton and am craving sushi, I'll end up here.","5"
"Jeff L.","The other reviews are correct. This is the best sushi in the Tri-Valley and possibly the East Bay. The sizzler layout fits the Japanese theme perfectly. Salmon, ikura and seaweed salad all beat expectations. Real sushi chefs. Great price for sushi this quality.","5"
"D C.","We've enjoyed dinner here for the fifth time the other night and continue to be impressed. The variety of sushi is phenomenal. We absolutely love the lime scallop sushi roll. I was definitely skeptical as it seemed an unlikely combination to appear in a sushi roll. So glad I trusted my husband's decision to order this item! While the bulk of the items we ordered are standard sushi fare--spider roll, ebi, unagi--they are all so beautifully presented and prepared with the freshest of ingredients. We highly recommend starting with the grilled edamame. Salty and grilled to perfection, this starter will provide a tasty way to open your meal.
Dining with our three-year-old toddler has never been an issue as we have had excellent, attentive service every time we have visited. Prices are well within the range of what most sushi bars/restaurants charge.
We have made this our new favorite place for sushi in the Tri Valley.","5"
"Stephen L.","This restaurant always serve excellent sashimi, sushi rolls, and grilled items. The Sashimi Salad, no matter that it is on each dinner's order, is always extremely satisfying. The slices of raw fish and raw scallops are out of this world, mixed in with different types of green and toasted almond flakes. Grilled escolar is tasty. Monk fish liver roll is a favorite, so is grilled steak (the appetizer). Save room for the best dessert - ice cream inside bite-size pancakes with strawberry and whipped cream. Regular customers go there every week. Wine, beer and sake are also very good.","5"
"julia f.","I love this place! Everything is so good, and not caked with sauces that overpower the food.
Their bento lunches are a ton of food for a great price, all of their sushi is amazing, and the sushi bar is so fun to sit at with the sushi chefs taking sake bombs with you.
They have great service, my drink is never empty, and they always remember what I order.","5"
"Christine C.","I loved Amakara! Some reviewers have noted that their fish was frozen, but my experience was completely different. A group of us recently went for my boyfriend's birthday and with the great service was awesome food. The fish was super fresh and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed myself. I will no longer look at octopus and raw scallop the same way again. If I could give 4.5 stars I would docking .5 for the high prices, but because .5 isn't an option, It'll have to be a five! Go Amakara **High Five**","5"
"James N.","Amakara is Japanese food with some fusion to it. This place was a definite special treat for those who love Asian fusion and Japanese food. When I was looking for the restaurant I almost missed it since their sign was a bit small but it was the busiest place in the lot. The location is quite nice the interior has many tables and a bar off near the entrance. The staff on the restaurant are super friendly and work promptly on all our requests.
We had order so much that I didn't know half of what I was eating. The food was extremely good. The presentation and wow factor was all there. The fish is so fresh! Like the blue fin tuna, it practically melted in right in my mouth. The salad was very zesty had a nice lemon acid taste to it. It was my first time also trying out a fried soft shell crab, definite an experience within itself. All the sushi was excellent.
Since the presentation was so amazing, our whole table was clicking our cameras. (pictures are posted, you gotta check them out!).
Though the prices can be a bit high, it was definitely worth it. Food and experience at Amakara is unforgettable. 5 Stars","5"
"Barbara O.","This place is great! Sushi tasted super fresh, the wait staff were extremely attentive to our needs, and we didn't have to wait long even though it was a sat night. I loved all the food that we ordered and we even had the sushi chef prepare one roll of his own choosing and it turned out amazing. I ordered the Nova Scotia roll which was interesting but I probably wouldn't order it again...a little heavy with the dill. Other than that everything was great!","5"
"Gabriela N.","When I crave sushi I go to this place. I live in Dublin, so it is conveniently located nearby. I prefer the sushi bar. There you can find two exceptional sushi masters! (John and Ian....I think I got their names right). The place is very hospitable and clean. It's a great place for any occasion, from casual meal, business meeting, a date, or solo.
I enjoy the raw oysters and pretty much always let them make me their favorites. Another plus are the rolls are not Super Size. They are the right amount of food each bite. flavors are well balanced, and not
pretentious.
Speaking of pretentious, it's a great place if you are discovering your love for sushi. The servers are knowledgeable and helpful. You will not be intimidated if you are not familiar with the menu.
I find Dublin does not have the best restaurants, but this place is always consistent in their food and service. I've been to some other sushi restaurants in the immediate area, and have not been pleased with the quality of seafood.
P.S. they have a nice selection of beer, wine and sake as well.","5"
"Joanne C.","I haven't been to a really good Japanese restaurant in a long time.
Amakara is a great place. I rarely give 5 stars too. I've been here twice for dinner and love it.
The service is great. The waiters and waitresses are so polite and warm. They asked more than once if we needed anything.
I recommend getting the hawaiian roll. It was delish! And the grilled edamame. The main course dishes like teryiaki chicken come in huge portions. They make good drinks here too. I asked for something not on the drink menu. It was a mango lemon drop. They made it for me. It was yummy. The fish is really fresh and melts in your mouth. I would recommend this place to anyone.","5"
