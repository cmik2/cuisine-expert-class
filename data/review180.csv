"Natasha S.","Delicious! One of the best sushi places I have ever been to. Very busy and nice environment. Despite them being busy, wait time wasn't too long. Very affordable.","5"

"Matt M.","Been meaning to write a review for a while. I love love this place been coming for years and the sashimi and nigiri are so fresh. Great rolls as well but the quality of the fish is where they shine. Get here early for lunch as they are always packed!!!!","5"
"Geeto B.","This is the best Japanese restaurant place in in the tri-valley! The sushi and bento boxes are great. The atmosphere inside the restaurant is nice. The only drawback of this place is that it gets too busy! Got to make sure you get there very early or expect to wait a long time, but that goes to show how good this place is.","5"
"Andrew H.","Who would have thought that Amakara, a $$ restaurant, would be a better place to celebrate a 30th bday than Napa Rose, a $$$$ restaurant that's located in Disneyland?
We would have thought that the twice-as-expensive restaurant in The Happiest Place on Earth would have had the edge =P. But Amakara's manager, Millie, really went out of her way to help us celebrate, and to ensure we had a great, memorable time. I was impressed by how much she clearly truly cares about her customers and wants them to have an enjoyable experience.
My party ate at the two restaurants on back to back nights. To mark the special occasion, we wanted to just do a very simple, special gesture and have a surprise gift of alcohol sent to the table.
While Napa Rose ignored multiple requests and then were just generally unhelpful, Millie was the polar opposite. She spent extra time helping us choose a nice gift and planning things out, and then even checked in with us to make sure she could deliver a nice enough message with the gift.
Great food and service--and you don't even need to fly to Disneyland for it =).","5"
"Jessica S.","Best sushi place in the East Bay. They open for lunch at 11:30 and there is always already a line outside.
I either come here with co-workers or just grab a seat at the bar for a quick lunch.
You can't go wrong with anything here. They have bento box combos. The ramen is delicious, and the sushi rolls are really good and filling! The portions are pretty big!
Great service. I wish I lived nearby- I would come here all the time!","5"
"Mona I.","Best Sushi in Dublin, on par with Sushi spots in SF. Unique rolls.","5"
"Mimi T.","Whoa, I didn't know a place like this existed in East Bay, let alone Dublin!
This place is pretty awesome, as you can see by number or reviews (even though it's in Dublin) and number of stars its got.
I gotta say it's pretty pricey but you get hella food & it's great.
I ordered three rolls:
Cherry Blossom: very standard and good but not wowing
Spicy Crunchy Rainbow: above good, but kinda pricey
Klondike express: SO good! easily my favorite roll","5"
"Vince J.","I come here weekly, Chef Lee and the team are great. Fast service, quick seating and fresh fish.","5"
"Nicole G.","Such a yummy place to eat! Everything had so much flavor! My recommendation, however, is to make reservations! Quite a long wait, but very much worth it.","5"
"Gabs W.","I have tried so many Japanese restaurants and Amakara is by far my fav! Food is always excellent and if you have a taste for ramen this is where you want to go!","5"
"Rebekah D.","My boyfriend and I went to Amakara on Valentine's Day around 8:00pm and we thought there would be a long wait for sure. We were sat down within 20 minutes! We took a look at the menu and it had sushi for me, steak for him, and seafood galore for starters for us! We LOVED everything we ordered from the soft shell crab miso soup to the amazingly tender scallops, the sushi rolls, the steak, my drink! Our service was top notch as well and we tipped extra for her having to work on one of the busiest nights of the year for couples! All of it grade A, quality, and I cannot wait to come back!! Can I live here?","5"
"Ellie P.","I have been here two times, and both times I have had a great experience.
The waiters are so friendly and nice, and they gave us really good recommendations for the sushi. I love the bustling and lively upscale atmosphere of the restaurant, it reminds me of a place that should be in a big city. Even though it may be pricy, I think that is it worth it for the portions and the quality of the food.
At my most recent visit, I came with my family, and we ordered the Klondike Roll, the Red Dragon, and the Chili Spider Salmon for the rolls, and the Miso Ramen and Teriyaki Chicken.
The sushi is phenomenal, it was so fresh and tasty. Although we liked all of the rolls, we enjoyed the Klondike Roll the most, which was crab meat and tempura topped with avocado, tabiko, and teriyaki glaze. The Klondike is explosive with the best flavors and textures, salty from the tabiko and sweet from the teriyaki glaze and crunchy from the tempura and creamy from the slices of avocado. The other dishes, which had very big portion sizes, were also all delicious, as is everything that I have tried from here. Seriously, you can't go wrong with anything here.
There is a reason behind the hype for Amakara, and I fully recommend every sushi lover to come here at least one time!","5"
"Jibu J.","The best Sushi spot in the Tri-Valley. Been coming here since th y pretty much opened and they have never been a bad experience. Long waits for a table though.","5"
"Lloyd S.","We've been to Amakara multiple times, but this is my first review. We walked in on a busy Monday night, but honestly what night isn't busy here?! A table was a little tough to get without reservations, but we were immediately sat at the sushi bar, which suits us just fine. We had the shrimp mango roll, spicy crunchy rainbow roll, some salmon, yellowtail, and tuna sushi, and of course, the grilled Edamame. The rainbow roll, sushi, and Edamame, were all absolutely delicious. The shrimp mango roll was good as well, but it had a little fishy aftertaste. Overall, it's really hard to have a bad experience here. I would definitely recommend making reservations if you're looking for a table, but the sushi bar seems to flow quickly and the bar is always a good option as well. Kumpai!","5"
"Cody D.","Today was my second time eating at Amakara and it was as good as the first. They offer some unique rolls. Everything I have tried has been really good. Very fresh. Get weird with it and try their Caprese roll. They had a Premier League match on TV too, for sure the best thing to offer on a Monday at 1230pm.","5"
"Dorita W.","Best sushi restaurant I've had since living here for 8+years. My Sons love the teriyaki salmon! They love everything with Teriyaki! I love it All! My favorite large Hamachi Kama & a variety of fish! I've tried many if not all in the area, outside of & even the Bay. This place has my heart. The staff and Chefs are warm, welcoming, friendly, never forget a face and very Family oriented. I've shared this place with many friends and family. They feel as I do and it's the only sushi restaurant we will ever eat at!
Thank You Amakara","5"
"Rachel L.","Coming from a girl who has lived in Shanghai, Vancouver, Houston, Austin, and San Ramon, this is hands down one of the best Japanese restaurants I've been to for the food quality and value.
This being said, you should come here either for lunch or an early dinner because this restaurant waits for no one and does not take reservations. I went a couple of times between 6-7:30 and the wait was around 45 minutes, so come with patience and hungry anticipation if you plan on going here around those times!
The food here is amazing. Everything is delicious and in huge portions. My boyfriend ordered the Unagi Don ($22). The eel was extremely fresh and flavorful, and the entree was enough to feed 2 people, but I wanted to try other things on the menu and order my own entree. I decided to try their Ramen ($9) and didn't regret my choice by any means. The ramen was cooked in a savory pork broth with seaweed, bamboo shoots, and green onion on the side. This was a perfect dish for me because I was feeling a bit sick that day, so something warm in my belly really hit the spot.
This place was so good we came again and again for more. Some other recommendations I have for this place include the Klondike Express (super filling roll of sushi great for seafood lovers since it has crab shrimp and scallops), the Tempura Udon (you get a bowl of udon with a bowl of tempura on the side! appetizer + entree in one!), and the Takoyaki (classic Japanese appetizer that is the best intro to eating squid you will ever experience)
Alas, I am now back in Texas but would love to return here one day!","5"
"Mhateen W.","Ohhh mann went here with my friend for some sushi rolls and they were mouth watering good, soooo yummy kinda pricy but honestly worth it","5"
"Crissy G.","So this place is the happening place! This place is always crowded! We had to wait for a table. The wait isn't too bad since there are places to walk to and hangout at while you wait. I don't mind the wait, because the food was on point! I ordered a cocktail and even though it was from a can it was amazing! I would order another anytime! The food was so fresh! The fish was fresh and I just gobbled it down. The portion size was big! I was impressed with the presentation and portion size! This place is nice! The prices are a little high, but the service and the food was amazing! I will come back here again! I loved hanging out with my friends and eating some fresh sushi!","5"
"J D.","Noisy as heck! Good vibe. Often crowded. May have to wait a bit to get a seat. I still love this place and keep coming back. The rolls are great, the wait staff is engaged and helpful.
Highly recommended!","5"
