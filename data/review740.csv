"Jere D.","OK - so if I went there during a busy time, I probably wouldn't give 5 stars, but try going there off peak hours and I think you will be happy with the food. We (hubby and 3 kids) went on a Sunday night around 730pm. It was pretty full, but we were seated immediately. The hostess/waitress was really, really nice and pleasant. She quickly asked if we wanted any drinks and was ready before we were to take our order. My hubby and 7 year old ordered chicken teriyaki. The portions were pretty big. My 3 year old got ramen soup and looooooooooved it. She was so busy with her chopsticks and spoon, which is very rare! Both kids are usually extremely picky but they were happy with their meals and ate more than they usually would. That was a HUGE plus for us because the kids can get tired of the same old mac n' cheese, chicken nuggets, and cheese pizza from other restaurants! I opted for the katsudon donburi -- that was just OK. But if there's anything you MUST try, it's the Mango Shrimp roll. YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM. I am definitely going back very soon and I will just eat that! Hubby was impressed too and we agreed that we'd be coming back for more.
The bill wasn't too bad - about $65.","5"
"liz w.","I've been here a number of times, and have always eaten at the sushi counter, never at a table. Maybe that's why I always get good service? I love this place. The sushi is fresh and innovative; the head sushi chef (can't remember his name) has created special rolls for me when I tell him my favorite ingredients. I have never had a long wait. I think I'm going to go again tonight!","5"
"Mike M.","It cracks me up how several bad reviews come from the same retarded party of people. Never mind the fact that they were late for their reservation and standard waiting time for sushi on a Saturday nite is an hour! LOL Boo Hoo! I want something for free! Fine then we're leaving! (Huff!) What a bunch of pansies. If this place was my restaurant I would have kicked you out. How rude to automatically assume you're going to get free food! That's how bad things have gotten in the restaurant industry. People just want free stuff and if they don't get it, they slander an establishment due to their own ignorance. I laugh at you.","5"
"Betty D.","This is absolutely the best place for sushi in Dublin and surrounding areas. If I'm craving sushi, this is the place we go. So far everything we've ordered was delicious and makes us come back for more on a weekly basis. Service is always top-notch from the hostess to the waiter to the chefs.
You MUST try their hand-rolls. They are the freshest I've ever tasted. I usually get the scallop hand-roll, just a little bit spicy. Their tuna hand-roll is good also.
What you should order: Start off with either steamed or grilled edamame. Their udon is really filling and good. Their Katsuo Tonkotsu Ramen is a little on the salty side for me however.
Sushi: Their sashimi are so delicious. Never a disappointment and always fresh. Also try their tuna roll (but sub for salmon), dragon roll, rainbow roll, tropical punch, and the three of a kind roll. For a kick, order the jalapeno hamachi roll. Their lime scallop is my least favorite roll there. It's too limey for me.
Also their beef teriyaki is the best teriyaki I've ever had. They use grilled ribeye in teriyaki sauce and it's served with rice and salad. The meat is so juicy and tender. The rib eye steak looks good too and I'll try that next time.
All of our towner guests we've had, we've taken them here and haven't heard one bad thing about it. Close to home and I don't have to head into the city for some good sushi. SCORE.
Tip #1: It gets really crowded on the weekends. So sit at the sushi bar on a Friday or Saturday night. You'll get seated and served much faster.
Tip#2: Always make sure to look at the Special's Board when you first walk in. The recommendations on the food and drinks are usually good and you should definitely give it a try.","5"
"Jim L.","My wife suggested this place for our NYE dinner, she has had lunch here with co-workers and didn't have any complaints.
I would have never ""thunk"" a place like this existed in Dublin. Man! this joint is legit!
We started off with a couple of appetizers which consisted of Asparagus Beef Wrap and Fried Oysters. For the main event we had a Fish Foie Gras roll, I'm like ""what the hell""??.....I can always spit it out if I didn't like it! I liked it! We also had the Spicy Crunchy Rainbow and a Cherry Blossom. The food was fresh and well presented.
This place has great food and great service! What more can you ask for???? The owner even stopped by our table and asked if everything was okay??? I wished more restaurant owners would take time out to greet their customers.","5"
"Lisa T.","This is my new favorite sushi place in the Tri-Valley! Love! Love! Love it! The grilled edamame is THE BEST I've ever had! I've been here 3 times and the food is consistent and really fresh! My favorite picks are off of the Amakara Original list - Red Dragon and Tempura Asparagus. Fabulous!","5"
"Danielle M.","WOW! I love this place. It is not the only place I will go for Sushi.
The sushi is great, the fish is fresh, the staff are all friendly and the entire atmosphere is fantastic! The prices are higher then some other places, but you get what you pay for! The sushi rolls are HUGE and tasty.
They have a great wine list.
The grilled eddamame is fricking ridiculous! GREAT!
I read some of the other peoples bad reviews...it must be the competition posting that because they lost all their business when this place opened.
:o)
GO HERE AND ENJOY!","5"
"Joanne P.","Love the sushi.. The sushi chefs are great! They tend to be super busy on the weekends, so allow a little more time!","5"
"Taylor B.","this place is Amazing!!! and you have to try their edamame grilled. good drinks, good atmosphere and hot friendly waiters. I would go here everyday if I could.","5"
"Amy W.","Hands down - this is a 5 star rating. I was so pleasantly surprised. The sushi is presented beautifully and the menu is very creative. The grilled edaname was amazing. I also loved the jalepeno ahi. In a nutshell: Fantastic food, great service, and a cool atmosphere. You won't be disappointed.","5"
"KellyAnn J.","I totally enjoyed lunch at Amakaras! I ordered grilled edamame for starters, and couldnt seem to stop eating them, they were so addictive. My ice tea was green and yummy. The service was impeccable. The food, fresh and beautifully presented. The atmosphere was modern, clean, and welcoming. Its obvious the happy staff like working here, which is a big plus for many reasons.","5"
"Rebeca N.","This is the best sushi I have ever had!!! I recommend it to everyone! They have the greatest service and the food is so good! I have gone back now 4 times and have ordered a different sushi roll every time, the rainbow crunch roll is the best! And there tempura is so good, and yes you are probably thinking well isn't every tempura just fried the same way...no this is super good!!!","5"
"sophia c.","My friend and I have the same birthday, we came here with 2 other friends for double birthday dinner.
Food was good and pretty~
We ordered 2 cocktails, 1 udon, 3 rolls and 3 entrees (2 teri chickens + 1 tonkatsu, i think AND we each ordered a dessert)
In lieu of everyone singing happy birthday to us, our server took off two of our desserts (after checking our ids for the alcohol)
The rolls are definitely different, in a good way.
They have the usual rolls/entrees that you can get anywhere else, but if you're feeling adventurous, you've got to try their original concoctions!
Service staff is attentive and friendly. I can understand rolls taking longer to make, since the sushimen can only make so many at a time, that's why you should order a good combo of grill and sushi bar so you aren't stuck waiting for everything.","5"
"Lawrence C.","I really like this place! The sushi rolls are outstanding. Beautifully presented and they taste absolutely fantastic. We started off with the roasted edamame as others here have suggested. Yummy! Ordered three premium sushi rolls and 1 ramen for my 5 year old. The decor of the restaurant is hip with lots of windows all around. The staff is also very friendly, attentive, and accommodating.
We'll definitely be back!","5"
"Danny L.","This is my new favorite sushi place in the Dublin area. Great food, great service and a cool atmosphere. They have grilled edamame which tastes quite different from the steamed ones but just as good and addicting.
The Golden Shrimp is my favorite!!! The Shrimp Mango is also amazing! All of their sushi plates were well portioned, fresh, and tasty. I definitely recommend this place to sushi lovers in the Dublin area.","5"
"Rachelle M.","My husband and I eat here once a week. We usually bring a couple friends with us as well. Everyone loves it!!! Last week I tried the Seared Spicy Sesame Tuna Roll....Amazing! The Philly, Carpaccio of Hamachi and Spicy Tuna are among my faves.","5"
"Angie C.","Amakara is very yummy. I love the rolls. Very different from what you would get from any of the other local sushi places, and may I add the fish is very fresh. My only complaint is that Amakara does not open for lunch on Saturdays. =( other then that I love the service, and I love the food. =)","5"
"natasha z.","all i have to say is;
-sit at the sushi bar
-make sure daniel is making your rolls!!!!! he is the best freaking sushi master ever!!!!!!!!","5"
"Caroline C.","My cousin and her hubby introduced this restaurant to me. The first time we went to Amakara there was so much to choose from! We absolutely LOVED the Italian Roll and the Albacore Escolar Medley!
We enjoyed the food and our dining experiencing we went back a second time 3 days later... Katsuo Tonkotsu Ramen is phenomenal! And of course a second tasting of the Italian Roll!
This is also definitley a place we'll end up going to whenever we can't decide what we should have for dinner! If you're looking for a new Japanese place to try - Amakara is definitley worth it!","5"
"Denise B.","I've eaten her three times so far, and I've enjoyed it every time. The rolls are very fresh and you can taste the difference. My husband didn't enjoy it so much because he thought it was pricey, but I was happy to find out that the owner saw his review on Yelp and contacted him to come back and give it another try.
I've never sat at the bar but the service at the tables is alright. The wait staff leaves you alone for a while after you get your meal. Then you have to flag them down to get your drink refilled, your check or dessert.
Just on taste alone this is probably my most fave sushi place in the East Bay.","5"
