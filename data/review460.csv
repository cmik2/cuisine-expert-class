"Lisa T.","Love this place for sushi. Bring friends here and the food has always been excellent. Unfortunately, it can get very busy and the open room can get very loud. I'm hard of hearing so once it gets full you really can't carry on a conversation. With that said, you know the food is great if someone keeps coming back even though the ambience isn't good. Best sushi in Dublin without a doubt. My go to sushi place even with all the noise.",""
"Newonda N.","I recommend you either make reservations or arrive right before lunch or dinner begins. This place always has a line and is always packed. Their food is fresh and delicious. Their service is great. I love how the inside is decorated and is very clean. I highly recommend coming here if you're looking for delicious sushi.",""
"Gretchen T.","Got the Golden Shrimp roll and the karaage chicken. Total cost was $16.47. The flavors of both the roll and the chicken were excellent. The shrimp roll was really big, I couldn't fit one whole piece in my mouth, so it fell apart as I tried to eat it. The sauce was a bit spicy, which I liked. The karaage chicken had great flavor, the rosemary isn't overpowering and adds a nice touch. It was really busy when I got there, so I ordered to go, and it took 10-15 minutes for my food to be ready.",""
"Cecilia N.","OCCASION: Boyfriend and I just went to mass and he knew I wanted to eat sushi. He found this place via Yelp and picked it because it has really good ratings
ENVIRONMENT: Located in a Japanese plaza in Dublin. It was not easy to find from the street we came in to the plaza. It was raining and it was Saturday evening and it was extremely crowded. It took about 30 minutes to get us seated. We sat at the bar close to the TV where the warriors were playing. Right in front of us were the sushi chief masters! It was so amazing to see them make the sushi right in front of us.
FOOD AND DRINKS: My boyfriend got ramen and I got a few sushi dishes. The sushi were amazing and my boyfriend also scoop out some of his ramen for me to try. Ramen was especially good!
PRICE: Sushi is always expensive.
CUSTOMER SERVICE: Service was on point despite it being chaotic on a Saturday evening. Waitress got to us ASAP and helped us decide what to get on the menu. She came to check on us multiple times and took away our plates when we were done eating.
OVERALL: Great experience. People were really into the warriors playing on the TV at the sushi bar. Awesome experience watching the sushi chief making sushi right in front of your eyes! It makes you appreciate why sushi is so expensive!",""
"Bonnie H.","A very popular place, gets pretty packed around dinner time so come early or make a reservation! Note: the whole party has to be here for them to seat you.
I like their cherry blossom roll - pic worthy and delicious, and their salmon is fresh and tasty.",""
"Enrico G.","The best Japanese food you'll find in Dublin. Always a wait though :-/",""
"Craig E.","This restaurant is packed every day for lunch and dinner. The food is amazing and the menu is very extensive. There is something there for any appetite.
The salmon teriyaki is such a big portion you can make 2 meals out of it.",""

"Kellie N.","Hubby and I come here all the time so I have been bragging about this place to my friends for awhile now. I mean, it's that good!
Always expect a wait no matter what day it is; and expect a longer wait if it's a Friday or Saturday night. Make a reservation in advance if you don't want to wait. But no biggie, because you can get a drink at the bar while you're waiting. Once you sit down, everything's all good. Service is on point and food is simply delicious. The rolls are so fresh! Some of our faves are the tuna ceviche, spicy sesame seared tuna, Hawaiian roll, Klondike express, and you have to try the roasted edamame! I mean, I could go on and on. Oh! Since I'm a self proclaimed ramen snob and considering that this place is popular for their fresh rolls, their ramen is prettyyyy bomb too. Try it!",""
"Andrew R.","Me and wifey love this restaurant, we go there ones a week there is only one problem with the place which is a good problem as well the place is always full!!! 45min waiting is standard
We love you Amakara",""
"Patti W.","This is one of the best sushi bars in the area. Particularly love to be seated at the sushi bar and watch the chefs prepare some amazing food.",""
"Vladimir K.","I honestly don't know what's so good about Amakara restaurant. I have been to numerous way better sushi restaurants in Bay Area, with quite economical price but Amakara has its very own class. Everything here was little overpriced but the quality of food really deserves that price. I and my friend came here and we ordered Red Dragon Roll, Takoyaki appetizer, Three of a Kind, and fresh orange juice. Takoyaki was soft, delicious and fluffy from the inside and nice crunchy layer outside. It worth $8 whereas the same dish is easily available for half the price but once you try Takoyaki at Amakara restaurant you won't try this dish anywhere else; that additional amount really deserves that. The Red Dragon Roll was a big surprise. There was not anything at this restaurant which did not amaze us. The tuna taste very fresh and roll itself was like out of this world and this all food worth more than $16 but that quality of food worth more than that amount. I would rank 10 out of 10 to the quality of food and same ranking for the cooking and serving. I really enjoyed every single penny which I have paid to Amakara and I am looking to go over there again very soon.",""
"Emilia R G.","I've driven by this place nearly every day for the past year and finally went in. What a find! Awesome food! Good cocktails! Great prices! Service is excellent. Be forewarned that this place gets very busy and crowded. Best to stand outside before they open at 5:00pm. There will be a line. Either that, or come after 8pm. It's definitely worth it.",""
"Carli C.","Food is so good here, usually a long wait but totally worth it. Also, if you don't want to wait you can order take out. The fish is always extremely fresh and they have really unique roles!",""
"Carissa G.","Delicious sushi. My husband and I visited Pleasanton for work, we ended up eating here three times in 5 days. It's that good. A little pricey, but worth it.",""
"Todd M.","The hype is real!! I heard about Amakara during wine tasting at Mitchell Katz. Everyone said to try Amakara, and they were right!!! The sushi is fresh, flavorful, and they have some great unique rolls.
Considering how busy they are, the service is friendly and timely. I think Amakara has become my go to sushi place.",""
"Jim B.","Our favorite sushi place in Dublin/Pleasanton! The wait speaks for itself - despite the wait, food comes out fresh and fast.",""
"Chingmen L.","Will come back for sashimi!! They are fresh and good.
I got three different roll. Don't even remember their name. Rolls can't surprised my taste bud. Probably will come back and try their Nigiri.
I am so upset that they don't have Uni for today. But, it is fine.
My first visit is great. Also, beside all the rolls, I got chirashi and soft shell crab. Size are big enough.",""
"Sai J.","The best sushi in the bay! It's a must try if you haven't been here!",""
"Jennifer C.","Love this place! Their fish is the always great and the service is really good. We always get the Jalapeno Hamachi, Philly Roll and Sake Sashimi. Kind of limited but that's because my husband is allergic to shrimp but I always see great items that other people order. Best sushi place in town!",""
