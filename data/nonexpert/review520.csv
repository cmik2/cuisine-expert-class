"LilyAnn N.","My family loves coming to Amakara! I don't live in Japan. The food is always fresh & service is great!
Our most recent visit here was on my birthday. We always order a wide variety of foods and share.
Some of my favorites here are the sweet shrimp, gyoza, mixed tempura, and California hand roll without rice! I was introduced to the sweet shrimp by my sister-in-law and have had it twice now and love it! At first, I thought it would taste slimy & fishy, but I was wrong. It was sweet, delicious, and did not taste fishy at all.
Also, if you're looking for an alcohol beverage to drink, try their lychee sake!
We will continue to come here. I recommend getting here early if you want a seat because it gets quite busy every single day they are open!","5"
"Z Man 3.","Amazing Sushi and Japanese (for non-sushi lovers)!!!! MUST TRY!!
I am not Japanese. I cannot say enough about this place. One recommendation, GET THERE EARLY OR MAKE RESERVATIONS! Lunch: 11:30-11:45! The sushi is the freshest around and their Amakara Originals are amazing! Try the Chili Spider Salmon, Hawaiian, Red Dragon. Oh heck, try them all! Delicious!
For the non-sushi lovers, their teriyaki and tempura is awesome!
Appetizers - Asparagus Beef Wrap, Tuna Ceviche!
In the mood for a steak? Try the Ribeye. WOW! I put this cut up against any steakhouse in Dublin, prepared in true Japanese fashion, with sautéed spinach and garlic and yummy soy-butter! Mouth-watering.....
The staff are about the nicest bunch I have ever had the pleasure to dine with.
Sitting at the sushi bar, buy the chefs a round of SAKI BOMBs for a great time!
Amakara is Dublin's Gem! Enjoy!","5"
"JJ W.","This restaurant is fantastic! I am a fan. I have a feeling they will have to expand, as they are crowded every single night for dinner!! I am very pleased to see a restaurant doing so well in Dublin!!","5"
"J V.","My favorite place in the east bay! Taste, presentation, and aura are all superb.","5"
"Sheila Rae S.","I love amakara!!! The food is so yummy, the waitresses are very polite, and not to mention the presentation of the sushi! Very pretty! I most especially love the hostess Kayla Yabes! She is the sweetest person in the world!","5"
"Jose M.","OMG first time here, super delicious food. Cannot complain. It's under staffed, so it might take a while to get your Oder in. But if you arrive early enough you'll be fine. Try the Avacato Mango rolls YUM! and my new fave the Philadelphia cream cheese rolls(fried). Sushi is great here! Coming back baby! ;)","5"
"Marc S.","Excellent sushi house, fresh and delicious sashimi and rolls. The grilled edamame is a must have every time I go there. I've never had better edamame.","5"
"Jon G.","Hands down the best sushi I've ever had. Every time I'm down in the Bay I make it a point stop in. The other reviews that mention how busy it gets are right. I went last night with my girlfriend and we were lucky enough to snag the 2 open seats at the sushi bar right away as the other 20 ppl waiting for tables were with larger parties. The wait actually lasted longer than their closing time, we were there 1.5hr before that.
My favorite fish are yellow tail and tuna and I'm from the southwest so anything with jalapeños gets my vote. I suggest the Grilled Edamame, Hamachi Carpaccio, Jalapeño Hamachi roll, Sesame Seared Tuna roll, the Klondike roll and the Red Dragon roll.
Worth the wait for great sushi.","5"
"Chris D.","This place is slap 'ya momma good! It can be pricey but it is worth it. I had the Philadelphia and Hawaiian rolls. I normally order two rolls because one is normally small, these rolls were huge!! They brought out miso for free and have us some pieces to try with our meal.
Very clean, very professional, all of the staff stayed on top of the meal. Would recommend time and time again, best sushi around!","5"
"Bianca V.","My boyfriend and I went here this afternoon and it was full! Thats already a good sign. We looked at the menu while we waited to get seated; we didn't have to wait too long. We decided to order the tuna ceviche for our appetizer and it was amazing! It had mangoes, cucumbers and tomatoes in it which added a tangy and a much more fresh flavor to the ceviche but didn't alter the taste if the tuna! It also had some leafy greens added to it. It was a great dish and we loved it! Couldn't wait to come back for more!","5"
"Aida H.","Just right out GOOD! If you want Sushi there clearly is no other Place. Ok, I guess I was short for Yelp! So, let me tell you If you want a great experience and are prepared to be patient on the wait, you will truly have an amazing meal.","5"
"Kathryn O.","I've only ever been here for lunch but I've never been disappointed. The lunch specials are generous portions of really good food at reasonable prices (for sushi/shashimi). We had the special edamame (fried?) and it was a large portion to share and was very tasty. Overall, a great place for lunch in Dublin.","5"
"Helen M.","I came here with co-workers for lunch a few weeks ago. I am not a sushi person so can't give an opinion on it, but I did order the sesame chicken after reading all the yelp reviews and must say it was excellent! It was very good and the flavor was unique and didn't taste like a Smart & Final jug of sauce poured on chicken like some places. The place is decently sized but very busy during lunch hour and I can see why. This will be a regular for me and again the Sesame Chicken is a must try!!!!!","5"
"Daniel C.","First time here, and yes we were greeted by a wait list (1 hr but actual was 45 min) and a packed seating area and bar. The place had a festive, sports bar like ambiance. We skimmed the menu and noticed they serve contemporary Japanese, which to me means cuisine with a twist. Overall I give 4.5 stars rounding up to 5. Food quality, service, ambiance all outstanding despite the brutal wait.
I started with the Night Owl cocktail, which had passion fruit syrup, and the caffeinated vodka with Red Bull. They forgot the umbrella but the drink was great and refreshing.
We split the octopus and cucumber salad which had pickled seaweed, lots of cucumber, and just a few pieces of tender octopus (tako). Not bad, but wasn't too memorable.
Wife got the tonkatsu (lightly fried pork) with a tangy gravy on this huge platter of sushi rice and shredded lettuce. Pork was cooked perfectly - crispy skin, tender meat, and hardly any grease. Rice was seasoned and good, but salad was dry and lacking.
I got the combo sushi (choice of basic roll and five pieces nigiri) and an Italian Dragon roll. The Italian Dragon roll should be in the ""what were they thinking category"" but the flavors worked for me. Imagine a dragon roll but with some pesto sauce and topped with a sliced tomato marinated with a hint of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Talk about bold! Sushi otherwise perfect with melt-in-your mouth fish and loosely packed rice.
We will come again for sure, but take Yelpers advice and come here early, like just before opening.","5"
"Lala R.","Went to this place while visiting family up north and it was pretty amazing. The meso soup was tasty, the service was good even though they we're very busy, and they have the best yellow tail sashimi ! I will be back there next time i'm in the area!","5"
"Jocelyn O.","Calamari for starters hit the spot! Sashimi was fresh and delicious! Also tried the dragon and klondike express rolls -- both were yummy! Ended dinner with tempura ice cream, which was enough for the 4 of us! Definitely coming back to try other menu selections :)","5"
"Kristy W.","Outstanding. Great sushi. I'll be back and it's over an hour drive.","5"
"Ryan N.","my favorite sushi spot! Great atmosphere starting with the bartenders and sushi cooks! Been to many other sushi spots, and others don't compete in the friendly atmosphere. My girlfriend, who does not like seafood nor fish, loves sushi now because of amakara!","5"
"Roxy B.","I have been here many times....always amazing. The grilled edamame is delicious! The staff is friendly too.","5"
"Seth B.","Eric the bartender was extremely helpful, polite, and had great suggestions. He recommended some delicious rolls, my favorite was one that was seared with concentrated garlic. You'll have to ask him what it was ;)
There were a bunch of bros, hitting on chicks, being obnoxious, and giving Eric a hard time but he handled it like a pro and everyone left happy. He's also cute, very very cute. LADIES ;)","5"
