"Lisa R.","A group of us from work went back to Amakara for a coworker's birthday. I told our server about the special occasion and she brought out a complimentary dessert.
Like last time, Amakara is very clean and nicely decorated inside. Our group ordered five different sushi rolls and split them among the group. I know we got the special california, Klondike, mango and two other rolls with some kick to them. Everyone was very happy with the flavor of the food.
The waitress was very nice and attentive. She had a good level of service where she would check in on us, but was not hovering or absent. She also didn't seem rushed like last time (different server), even though there was a decent crowd for lunch.","5"
"Ann N.","Cute restaurant for a date. Their sashimi is fresh and generous in portion. Their sashimi salad is really good. One of the best Japanese restaurant in the bay.","5"
"Cindy M.","I rate this place five stars for our first visit and the dishes we had.
The restaurant is on the larger side, crowded for a lunch crowd, but with plenty of seating. I liked the modern, clean decor and friendly service. The menu was extensive so we asked our server for a recommendation on rolls.
We actually came in because I wasn't feeling well and wanted soup. I ordered the spicy ramen to start. It was enough for my husband and I to share. The noodles were perfect, not overcooked. The broth was flavorful and spicy, with seaweed, white corn and a poached egg. We also ordered hamachi carpaccio. Four thin pieces of fish were drizzled with a light garlic sesame oil, topped with cilantro, jalapeno and a slice of fresh tomatoe.
The two rolls our server steered us to were spicy crunchy rainbow and Klondike experience. They both had great flavor with a combo of sauces and tobiko. I favored the Klondike myself. We always finish with sashimi which is the final test to really rate a Japanese restaurant. Our server recommended the mustu (butterfish) which was melt in your mouth delish. The shiro maguro (albacore) was fabulous as well. The sake (salmon) was our least favorite. We couldn't believe the ginormous portions and freshness of every ingredient. Very good food indeed. We'll be back to try more.","5"
"Calvin S.","Amakara has the best sushi in the bay area hands down! I've been eating sushi for about 16 years sampling restaurants all over the bay area, and amakara Is consistently the best I've had. The quality of their fish and all ingredients Is always superb and I've never been disappointed. Service wise- I've had a couple issues with their servers. On a few separate occasions my server acted very unprofessionally. Also there was one time where my server did not speak very good English and that caused a bit of an issue. Other than that amakara is a must go to sushi bar even if u don't live near by, its worth the travel! Try the Italian roll it's amazing:)","5"
"Stephanie P.","My absoluate favorite all time suishi place!
I visit here monthly (or more) when on business trips to the area. Seating is always easy to get during the week at dinner time.
I usually start off with the grilled edamame which has olive oil and salt/pepper on it - much better than the standard boiled stuff!
The shashimi has spoiled me in that it just doesn't seem as fresh when I go elsewhere! The red dragon roll is a favorite along with the spicy tuna and philadelphia roll.
Good drink menu too.","5"
"Avery B.","I love this restaurant! The food and atmosphere are so great. The Amakara cocktail is the best! Portions are the perfect size. It's a clean restaurant too.","5"
"daniel c.","Ok, i have been using Yelp for all these years and have been very reticent about actually writing a review. In an effort to be something other than just a user of the service, I thought I would actually contribute.
So we were looking for sushi on Mother's Day, and found this place with the highest reviews close to San Ramon. I lived for several years in San Francisco, and know what good sushi is ..... This place has good sushi.
Based on a yelp recommendation, we tried the grilled edamame (yep, they were a must do for a warmup) and fried oysters (wife loves them) for appetizers. For a main course, we had 4 rolls (California roll -for my son and daughter, Fried California Spicy Tuna, Spicy Crunchy Rainbow roll, Spider roll, and the Cherry Blossom roll. And for desert we had the Tempura Ice Cream.
The rolls were really fresh and not skimpy on the fish to rice ration. Also, they were nicely decorated and the plates looked really delicious. We inhaled the rolls, along with a Sapporo (or two) so cant really give a detailed analysis of the taste of the individual rolls other than to say they were as good as anything I have ever had. The rolls we had came with some sauce on top, and fish eggs, which really made the rolls look nice and taste great.
I would love to say ""the food her was really bad and the service was very poor"" but the only reason I could justify doing that would be to keep everyone away so I could have this place all to ourselves. In reality, this place is really good, moderately priced, and with a friendly staff that is accommodating and efficient. Our new go to for sushi in Dublin.","5"
"Lucy D.","I overed dinner take out from this place a couple of times and they have bomb food.
The uni is awesome. It's the creamiest uni I've ever had and it just melts in your mouth. I get it every time without fail. The sashimi is really fresh and they have creative rolls. Like someone else mentioned before, they go through so many orders on a daily basis that the fish must be fresh right? They also have some interesting miso soups like grilled eggplant miso and crab miso. The grilled edmame were delicious; salty and addicting. I would also recommend the Klondike roll. It's packed with fish!
I've seen large crowds waiting for tables around dinner time on various weekdays starting around 6-6:30, so if I were to sit down and eat there, I'd definitely make a reservation. If you show up around 7 without a reservation, have fun waiting. I can't say much about the atmosphere but they do have a full bar and the bartender is very nice.","5"
"Liz O.","This place is amazing!
The atmosphere, people, the entire place as a while works very well.
The sushi is fresh everyday and the rolls leave you filled.. so ordering 2 - 3 is not needed.
The SCALLOPS PARADISE is DELICIOUS! Everyone should try at least once. The scallops are lightly deep fried (honestly very thin coat) served on rice with spicy sauces, fish eggs etc. These bite size pieces leave you wanting to order more! lol
The ""G SPOT"" is a secret roll they have. If you like mango def order.. ask them to make is spicy with cream cheese and you will be in heaven!","5"
"Lora M.","We've been coming back here ever since I set foot on this place. Always an A+ experience.
I had my birthday dinner here last week and I had a good report from my wonderful friend who planned the dinner of how she was helped right away with the cake and all soon as she got there. Food and service is always excellent! Thank you!","5"
"K S.","Amazing sushi and so many specialty rolls to choose from. Rolls are quite big so the price is definitely worth it. And the grilled edemane - a house specialty - is delicious!
Friday nights are packed so call ahead for a reservation ... but even without a reservation, the sushi is definitely worth the wait.","5"
"Tram N.","I made reservations for yesterday evening for one of my best friend's birthday and not only was the table ready, the nice girl at the front helped me w/ the cake, cupcakes, and other goodies to the table! The ice cream cake was put in the fridge w/o being asked! I was super impressed!
When everyone arrived, our server offered to chill and pour our champagne.
I did not enjoy dinner here since it is against my diet to be eating past 4:45pm and I'm currently a weekday lacto-ovo vegetarian so I enjoyed the conversations, laughter, the Sprout (the baby), and my diet soda.
I'm not sure what everyone ordered but their plates looked awesome (from size to presentation). I wanted to break my diet right then and there but then I remembered that I need to look good for this Saturday's dinner at Crab House in SF!
Anyway... I was first to arrive and how odd, I got off work, had to go home to change, gather the goodies and gift, pickup the Sprout, managed to weed through idiots on 680N, and still managed to get there 20 minutes early! Reservations: 7. I got off work: 5:30 and I had to commute from San Jose! That is true - I do not run on Asian time. I hate people that are late, BTW.
First to join me was Marie K.! I haven't seen her in almost 2 years! Glad to hear her current life situations (we'll double date soon) and then Els (Angel B.) and Paul were next. Paul is super cool and based on my best friend's reaction throughout the evening.. they fit very well together and I can't wait to double date w/ them, too! Vi's (Vi T.) pretty self joined and then the birthday girl (Lora M.) and her boyfriend... like a Yelp gathering! **Note, the birthday girl, Vi, and Els are my best friends.. my stories might be confusing!
Everyone ordered and seemed to enjoy their food! Again, service was AWESOME.
The whole entire time I was having a ball but missing a component: my babe.
Oh yeah, if you have a cake and forgot candles, Amakara has them!
I will be back to actually eat next time. This place rocks!
Next we should have a 5 couple date w/ everyone involved last night, haha.","5"
"Nia Q.","I cant get enough of this place. It is one of the reasons why I moved back to Dublin :) My favorite rolls are: Spicy Seared sesame tuna,Rainbow roll, Klondike roll and the BESTTTTTTT tuna ceviche salad... oh and the grilled edamame! You cant go wrong with this place... but be prepared to spend a lot of $$$$! Not a cheap place :)","5"
"John Y.","We've been coming here since Amakara opened a few years back. Since they were a new restaurant and the economy just in the toilet, we wondered if this place would survive. We've always loved it here too. We didn't really have to worry much. This place ROCKS and knows how to ROLL (sushi that is!).
The wife and I came here for a sorta-late dinner (for us anyways) on Saturday night. The place was crowded! There was a 30 minute wait, so we ambled up to the bar and hung out for a bit. It was kind of fun to watch all the activity in this place. It took a while to get our drinks-just about everybody seemed to be ordering mixed drinks! Chatted with the bartender in between his pours. Very nice guy.
Sat at the sushi bar. Those guys were hopping! It was tough to get their attention to get your sushi order in. Maybe I was being too 'proper', so I just yelled out a few items and they got right on it. EVERYTHING was awesome. The service was friendly and prompt (even on a super busy night) and the fish was one of the best I've had in a LONG time. It was nice running into our buddy Michael who works there.
We left totally satisfied after a nice evening out. Sitting at the sushi bar, you get dinner AND a show!
If you dig sushi, you gotta make Amakara a destination spot for your culinary adventures! You will thank me after your very first bite!

"Emily Y.","My favorite Sushi spot in the Tri-Valley!
I love sitting at the bar with a glass of wine and watching them work! We came here twice on weekend evenings and the place is always lively, which I love to see when I go restaurant hopping.
For starters, we ordered the hamachi kama which I've had twice and each time, I enjoyed it. I think the sauce is the winner on that dish, but the fish is cooked perfectly and falls right off the bone.
Next, spicy tuna is another yummy dish. I've had a lot of spicy tuna in other places but this place makes it on the spicier side but you can still taste the hint of sweetness in the tuna. It's delicious.
We had the dragon roll which wasn't amazing but I'd order it again.
I love raw fish so We had tuna and the albacore sushimi. Very fresh.
Also, their grilled edamame is good as an appetizer. A bit oily since they use olive oil but has the right amount of salt and good to munch on while you're waiting for your main dishes.
I don't recommend getting the scallop mayo. I love scallops and I thought scallops in mayo would be interesting to taste. It was interesting...in a bad way. I felt like I was eating a big tablespoon of fatty mayonnaise. I couldn't taste much of the scallops because it was overwhelmed by the mayo. If you love mayo, go for it but it's definitely on my Stay away list when I come here.
The servers and bartenders were very friendly and patient with us. Not disappointed with the service at all.
It's a bit on the pricey side but the quality of the food is worth the price.
Order the Hamachi Kama at least while you're there. I've never had it before until I came here and it's something I'll order straight away next time I'm here :)","5"
"Jessica H.","My fiancé and I have been coming here since we moved to Livermore a few years back. I constantly hear bad reviews about their service, but honestly, we have never had anything but exceptional service (and I'm picky...). I want to especially point out Eric, bartender/waiter: attentive, knowledgable, and fun! He puts up with my quirky sense of humor, knows when to leave us alone and when to ""get involved"".
Next the food: fresh fish! Hamachi Kama to die for! Oysters on the half shell that aren't on the menu but if you ask, they have the most exquisite presentation of oysters with tobiko, scallions and a little bit of hot sauce.
If you want good sushi in the Dublin/Pleasanton area, this is your place!","5"
"Rick O.","Amakara was fantastic! The uni was fresh, buttery and a little sweet. They were out of toro but the maguro, hamachi and kanpachi were excellent as well. We had a couple of rolls too. I'm not a big fan of the California roll, but my guest wanted to try it. It was really good! The best I've ever had. Large size, great crab to veggie ratio. We also had a dragon roll that was excellent. The tempura shrimp stayed crunchy through the whole meal. Prices were reasonable. We had the 2 rolls, 4 uni, 4 hamachi, 2 maguro and 2 kanpachi. With one beer and tea the total came to about $65. The ambiance was great. We wanted to sit at the bar but it was full. We got there at about 8 and there were only a couple of open tables. The atmosphere was clean, casual and inviting.
Overall, I highly recommend it. My guest was from Japan and she loved it. Her description of the experience is ""Mmmmmmmm"" and ""Happy"". I guess that's a two thumbs up.","5"
"Kim T.","Admirable. Yet another owner that reads the reviews, good, bad etc. :D Two thumbs up for Tae!","5"
"Yvonne A.","I use to live in San Francisco and I totally miss the great food!! I am so glad my hunny and I found this sushi place! The food is awesome! The service is good too. We have been there at least 4-5x and we've always been happy with everything! One of my favorite dishes there is their grilled edamame! Another one of my faves is their asparagus roll! If you're in Dublin and want to try a good sushi place, this is it!
This place does get busy so you might have to wait a bit to get seated. Other than that, it's great!!!","5"
"Paul C.","Fantastic sushi. We had three rolls and they all were great (sorry i don't remember the names). The grilled edamame was fantastic as well. Two of the rolls were spicy and delivered just the right amount of heat. I suggest trying to get reservations - very popular joint.","5"
