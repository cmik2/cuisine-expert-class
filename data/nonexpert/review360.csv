"Cherie R.","AMAZING! I have been going to Amakara for almost 5 years and have to say the food is always great. The prices are reasonable and the food is always fresh, and filling. I love the Sushi, never have been disappointed. Love Millie and the staff, always inviting and very warming when you arrive. It's a great feeling when they know you by name and care about your family. Great job Peeps, keep up the good work!!!","5"
"Marcus A.","Amakara really stands out as the best sushi in the area! It's busy always! Some days if you get here right before opening there is already a line outside waiting until they open. I've never had a bad item. Some highlights are the grilled edamame it's a must get! Asparagus roll, red dragon roll and more! Love the sashimi to! Tastes so fresh!","5"
"Judy L.","I've been coming here for over 5 years now, and it's consistently good sushi.
Eddie, thanks for accommodating us at the bar a couple weeks ago with our customized handrolls! Hope you enjoyed the sake.","5"
"Manny B.","Sashimi salad is awesome! Pair that with the fried calamari and you're up for an amazing treat. This has been our favorites for a year now. We've tried other local Sushi spots but always leave asking ourselves why we ventured off. Get there early and be hungry my friend!","5"
"Paula C.","My husband and I love Amakara. Fantastic sushi, unique menu and good prices. We call and get take out cause people are lining up at 5:00 when they open.","5"
"Bob D.","Wow what a meal! Decided to eat at the bar because Elaine & Myly were so attentive and creative at recommendations! Had the yellow tail collar and grilled edamame for apps. The collar is INCREDIBLE! Proceeded to have a combo salmon (wild, regular & fatty) which was even better. My wife had never eaten raw fish bur Myly convinced her - she loved it!
You have to try this place! Top 10 sushi place in the bay and top 2 in east bay!","5"
"Carlene K.","the best place for sushi in the bay area. go right when they open ir u may have to wait an hour","5"
"Kyle E.","Best sushi restaurant, and possibly best overall restaurant, in the area. It's usually very busy in the evenings, but the food is worth dealing with the crowds. The sushi is great but we've also enjoyed the agedashi tofu and eggplant and grilled beef.","5"
"Paul K.","Food: Excellent and fresh. I love their Sashimi and rolls. Never disappointed. Their tempura is very good also as it is the type that is very crunchy/crumbly on the outside, yet perfectly cooked on the inside. I've also tried their oyster shooters which are a big hit with me... too bad their about 8 bucks a pop!
Service: Friendly staff, no issues here. Thumbs up.
Ambiance: Nice atmosphere. It is very crowded during dinner, even the middle of the week. Plan accordingly. They don't take RSVP's unless there is a certain number of people in your party.
Location/Accessibility: Easy to get to and parking has never been an issue. They are located withing a shopping center so there is ample parking.
One of my favorite Japanese restaurants in the East Bay... Just very very crowded at times. I've waited an hour once, but it was worth it.","5"
"Suzie Q.","pretty much there's nothing to not like bout this place. they got big parking lot, good food, fresh fish, great n quick service, n full bar! Certain dish are pricey, for instance, the spicy crunchy rainbow was good n it is crunchy but priced at $17 seem a bit too much. However, the uni sashimi was only $16! Many places I been to charges around $25! Ya MUST order the fried edamame! Beware tat it'll make u want more n more...so addictive! The tropical roll was too sweet bc of the sauce. yellowtail was fresh n cut just rite. the oyster in ponzu sauce was also good, very small but meaty enuf. the best n most amazing was the uni sashimi. Very fresh!","5"
"Carolyn D.","Always the best!!! awesome sushi - fun bartenders, especially Millie, and Jameson. Try the grilled edmame and spicy rainbow rolls. Well worth the wait (which there usually is.)","5"
"Ira S.","We love this place, busy and exciting place to eat. Sushi are amazing not only in presentation but taste. Love..love the grilled edamame. Spicy ramen is amazing even without any meat. Will definitely come back many more times .","5"
"Madeleine H.","I only eat sushi at Amakara; I realize that's a statement. No sushi compares to the offerings at Amakara, and therefore I would rather pass on sushi when in other cities and wait-it-out to come to Amakara. Fresh fish, all real crab, great flavors. Typically, I go for rolls, but, at this point, I have all of their menu. Here are the standouts, but highly likely anything you choose you will be happy with.
+ Spicy Seared Sesame Tuna
+ Klondike Roll
+ Chile Spider Roll
+ Red Dragon Roll
+ Spider Roll
+ Agadashi Tofu
+ Chicken Teriyaki
+ Spicy Ramen
Options for brown rice on rolls, as well as with entrees. With smaller parties, opt for first available and sit at the sushi bar. Sometimes the wait can be unbearable, but you can wait for a table outside or at the bar.","5"
"Herman G.","I eat here about once a week...whether it's carry-out or in the restaurant. The service is always top-notch and the quality of fish is second to none. It tastes incredibly fresh and always leaves me happy and excited for the next time I visit this amazing spot.
The only downside (if you can consider it one) is that it's so amazing, you will rarely get in without a wait. During this difficult time, I suggest ordering a drink from the bar!","5"
"Lindsey B.","Hands down one of my favorite sushi places in the east Bay Area! The sashimi is always fresh, the sushi rice is cooked/prepared correctly and everything is always sooo yummy! If you eat at the sushi bar, sit in Yo's section, he is one of the best Japanese sushi chefs I have met!","5"
"KK L.","This place is fantastic. Try the Amakara original rolls. You will not be disappointed. I dream about this place! Yum!","5"
"Ying H.","Service is really good and Components of each dish are a lot of, I feel particularly good.","5"
"Denise B.","Off the hook!!! Turned around and drove 5 miles in the opposite direction to try this place..shrimp ceviche sooooo good, l would come back just for that.
Quick service and everything was delicious!!!","5"
