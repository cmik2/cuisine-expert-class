"Jacquelyn W.","If there is a wait, sit at the bar! You can start with a cocktail or an ap until you get seated and the bartenders are super friendly. Actually, the entire staff is! They are very fast at getting tables cleaned an resat, so the wait is normally not very long, and it seems like less when you have a yummy drink it your hand.
The fish is very fresh and high quality, so its not the cheapest place you've been to... But its totally worth the price. The have a large selection of rolls that aren't just california +one fish... The have variety!","5"
"Kristina N.","I love this place. Their sushi was good. I love their hamachi sashimi. It was my favorite and their rolls are super good as well. Their service is great.
The best part is that you can tell that their fish is fresh!!","5"
"Amber H.","I dream about sushi because of this place....
My husband and I have been searching for amazing sushi since we moved here two years ago.... We found it here!! They have an interesting menu with great rolls and amazing service. The sushi is a few dollars more on average but they make up with it through taste and the rolls are a little longer here than many places I have tried.","5"
"James A.","Best Sushi I have ever had. Been to quite a few places. The spicy tuna roll here is amazing. My favorite roll by far. Great atmosphere. Great Service. A must visit!","5"
"Dar V.","WOW! Just WOW! Four of us shared a tempura combo appetizer,(very light and tasty batter) and their grilled edamame (olive oil and garlic salted deliciousness).
I don't think I will ever not grill my edamame at home, it is genius.
Then we chose three rolls. Every single one made our eyeballs roll back in our heads. Scallop with fresh lime, Crunchy Rainbow Roll, lovely fresh fish, the crunch is from bits of tempura batter sprinkled on top rather than a deep fried roll which made it much lighter and fabulous, and the Klondike Roll was very yummy too. We were all pretty full but our mouths still wanted more so we asked our server for a recommendation. She suggested the roll with mango, and it was so good we wanted to kiss her. Total bill to which we added a 20% tip was $100!! We were so surprised that we all double checked the bill. True we didn't have alchohol but still, we felt like it was an amazing value. Did I mention that the rolls were GIGANTIC?
I want to go back right now.","5"
"Jenny M.","Try the grilled edemame! It is SOOOO good. All of the rolls are yummy and the ramen is fantastic, too. Just be sure to expect to wait around for a table because clearly word has gotten out the Amakara is the place to go. It gets very busy!","5"
"Anthony T.","Best sushi I've had ever. I don't say that lightly. Service was excellent, rolls are a little pricey though. However, they are very creative and extremely delicious. Taking my friends back who are in the mood for sushi.","5"
"Helen W.","OMG! Amakara is in a class of it's own. Absolutely amazing. Very busy and popular. No wonder! Tried to make it early on a Saturday...even 5:30 was a 30 minute wait. The bar is right at the entrance and an easy pit-stop while waiting. The bartenders put on a great show. Some folks call in ahead, but that only works if they aren't too busy to pick up the phone! The food...OMG. The Shrimp Ceviche is to die for. Talk about a lady O in the mouth! Just incredible! Very fresh with an amazing melding of shrimp, mango, tomato and avocado. Even the miso had an unusual depth of flavor that most don't. The Spicy Crunchy Rainbow and Dragon Roll were awesome. The service was prompt and attentive. Highly recommend!","5"
"Lisa T.","It's 2014 and I'm still a regular customer here at Amakara! In my opinion, it's the best sushi in the Bay Area. Give it a try and I guarantee, you won't be disappointed.
Popular items: grilled edamame, spicy crunch rainbow, deluxe california roll, beef (ribeye steak) with eggplant.
I eat here at least 2 times per week for dinner and or lunch. The red dragon is delicious as is everything else. I never have to wait but I roll solo most of the time..lol","5"
"Joyce P.","I had the Spicy Sesame Seared Tuna Roll. It is very different and good, the jalapenos really make the roll complete.
I found the service to be very good, and people complain about the wait times, but if you come to a popular restaurant during lunch or dinner time, what can you expect?
I especially the bartender Eric was very nice and incredibly good looking. He made a very good Oscar the Grouch (made with sage) and AMF and was very accommodating.","5"
"Drew W.","Amazing sushi. Whether ordering from the Sushi Bar or the menu you'll be impressed with the quality/freshness of the fish, the beauty of the dishes, and the overall tastiness of everything. Grilled Edamame is a great way to start off your meal followed by whichever rolls catch your eye. It can get crowded but that's to be expected when the food is so so good.","5"
"C Q.","really great sushi! I recommend the dragon roll! we also had the Philidelpia roll, meh we didnt like that one too much.. but anyways the food was great and atomosphere was great!","5"
"Sashini W.","Hands down best sushi in the area! My bf and I have been here a few times now and we love it so much. The service is great, the ambiance is great, and the food is awesome. We always sit at the bar and the bartenders are so hilarious and make excellent drinks. My favorite is the Blackberry Sage Kamikaze, definitely worth trying. Every sushi roll is good and you cannot go wrong by eating here!!
Pros:
*Easy to find/ private lot
*Amazing food/drinks
*Fried Ice cream dessert is ridiculously delicious
Cons:
*Make a reservation or end up waiting because they're always packed!
LOVE them :)","5"
"CS C.","Went here for dinner on a Friday night...
This place is awesome and one of my favorite sushi places in the Bay Area. Went here on a Friday night and it was packed....full house.
This restaurant is a contemporary Japanese/Sushi place and this is reflected in the ambiance and decor. They have a full bar with beer on tap and many interesting original cocktails that are quite good. The staff is attentive and friendly, especially the sushi chefs.
The food...
I have only tried the sushi and it has always been excellent. This place has lots of original and contemporary sushi rolls that combine different flavors to produce an amazing end result. The fish is always fresh.
It's not the cheapest sushi in the world but the prices are well justified due to the excellent quality and generous portion size.","5"
"Jared N.","Awesome place for sure! Came here with a friend. Great service and very welcoming and aware of our presence in restaurant. Fun little place with great menu.
Had grilled edamame. That thing is seriously gigantic. Comes in salt and olive oil and so much better than normal edamame! Definitely recommended.
I had the sashimi platter. Fatty tuna, salmon and yellow tail. Great slabs and gigantic fresh. Buttery texture and full flavor. Best I've had. The yellowtail was simply divine definitely a treat Waiters and staff are friendly and awesome
Bottomline. Come if your in the area and eat the grilled edamame and fresh sashimi. Yellowtail highly recommended.","5"
"Kevin P.","I love sushi. Amakara has the best sushi. I love Amakara.
The food is over the top delicious. Every sushi place tries to put a twist on their food/rolls to make it original, often times it turns out weird or cheesy. Amakara does this right. C'mon, grilled and salted edamame, beautiful plate presentations, unorthodox flavors that really work?! You can't beat it. You just can't.
The bar is really nice. Their signature cocktails are fun, they have a nice variety of Japanese beers on tap, there is a happy hour... Sake... did I mention Sake?
Being in the suburbs, Amakara is more likely to be crowded on weekend evenings rather than weekdays. When they are crowded, it takes quite a bit of time for the sushi to come out. They won't sacrifice quality.
This is a great place for a date. Personally, I wouldn't really want to bring more than seven or eight people at once though. Also, they close at 9:00PM on weekdays, so get there early, or you will be sad! The early closing time is probably the worst thing about Amakara, but it is really only bad because it is such a great place. Again, the suburb thing makes the closing time pretty logical. If you ever decide to stay open until 10 or 10:30 on weekdays, you have my vote!
You will often see the owner socializing with everyone. He obviously loves his job!
LASTLY, YOU REALLY HAVE TO TRY A SPICY CRUNCHY RAINBOW ROLL. SERIOUSLY.","5"
"Tiffany N.","Recently went here for my boyfriend's mom's birthday with the whole fam. We made a reservation for 7pm on a Saturday for 7 people (they said all 7 people have to be there within 10 mins or our reservation would be canceled), but ended up calling them to push it to 730pm since we went for a spontaneous swim and knew we wouldnt make it there on time. They were really nice about this and let us do 730pm. What great service :)!
As for the food: YUM. I have only gone here 2 times and each time the fish was super fresh! I usually order the cherry blossom roll ($13ish?) with just salmon (i dont like tuna :P) & my boyfriend orders the chirashi($25). Super fresh and super yummy. Not only this but when we asked for extra ginger, they gave us a whole bowl full of ginger! yay! They are so courteous. and our waitress, I wish I remembered her name, always came by to check on us and refilled our waters and teas. Not once were our cups empty.
Definitely will be coming back again with just my boyfriend for our next special occasion. looove this place","5"
"Tim G.","I learned recently that Amakara literally translates into ""Eric makes crazy good drinks that moonwalk into your mouth"". Had a blast up at the bar kicking it with Big E.
First got there on a Sunday night and it was pretty busy . I always decide to sit at the bar cause It's where I'm the most comfy . Plus I wanted to see what happened in the Olympics even though I knew the results because taping them is lame sauce. Anyways Eric was really busy because he had tables as well but was making drinks with Ninja like speed also for needy people with their crushed iced fetishes.
Food was awesome . Shrimp Ceviche was a jump kick of flavors and the Asparagus Steak whatever were awesome as well.
It's rare to find a bartender around here with personality, mostly I've dealt with are a pulse rate away from being a zombie. So all in all Amakara is B.A. Sit at the bar And show Eric love . He deserves it.","5"
"Jeannie W.","I went here for the second time, once for lunch and for dinner for my last visit. I really enjoyed my firt visit. A friend and i, we had a lot for lunch: cold soba, poki salad, super salmon spider and the ""something"" rainbow roll. To top our meal we had green tea ice cream. The meal was more pricey than other nearby japanese restaurnts but it was worth every penny. Came to 80bucks. The only thing that i didn't like was i felt sort of kicked out...they close at 2 for lunch but we still had 10minutes...
My second dinner visit we sat at the bar and the owner eddy made us a special treat with hirame, albacore, all presented in a incredible way. We also had amakara cocktail, the acai berry cocktail and 1other i don't remember. It was worth the $8.
I really recommend their green tea ice cream. Its nothing special but what made it grrrreat was they sprinkle green tea powder and that just did it. If it comes out w/o much sprinkled on it be sure to ask the server for more cause it makes a huge difference.","5"
"Isaac K.","I know I know.. I'm supposed to be writing an extensive review on the food and what not - but this review will be a little different. Forgive my yelp mannerisms, for this is my first review on here (not counting the 1 ""tip"" I posted via iPhone).
Okay, let me get one thing out of the way: I've honestly never been here. Hey! Hold your judgement real quick! I just wanna point out that based on the previous reviews here, it seems as though service at a restaurant can truly make or break one's satisfaction in their meal. No matter how superb a meal is, if the service is mediocre, the business is bound to receive just 1 STAR on yelp. Which is crazy! I, for one, don't really care much for the service. As long as the food is delish - I'm happy and the business will get a positive feedback in my book. The food and service must be truly downright HORRIBLEEEEEeeEeeEeEEeeEE for me to give a business 1 star. Even giving them 1 star seems so degrading. There are so many factors that can play into slow service and long lines such as some kitchen appliance not working that day (happened to me before), or the sushi chef missing that day ;) haha, or the owner's dog eating all the checkbooks! Who knows! LOL in all seriousness, be kind because we're all human.
ANYWAY! Speaking of kindness.. What I can say about this restaurant is.... *drumroll please*.....that THE NICEST girl I know works here! I'm not even lying. Although she's new and never worked in the restaurant business before, don't let that deter you; I know she'll do her BEST to accommodate you. Her name's Laura and I know you won't regret having her as your waitress/server. FUN FACT: Her dream as a child was to work in a restaurant and that dream was fulfilled when she began working at Amakara recently. Hahahaha how cute is that :)
Food: If I went here, I would definitely try the toro and the spicy crunchy rainbow! All based on what I see in the pictures, haha!","5"
