"Katina K.","I've eaten at a lot of sushi places in my time and ALWAYS compare them to Amakara. I have been going to Amakara since it opened. Let's just say I had my 15th birthday party here and I'm 23 almost 24 now. Before Amakara, I was going to the owner/head chef's other restaurant that he worked at in Stockton. To make a long story short this place is good, better than good... it's the best! They are pretty much always busy so make sure to either make a reservation or get there and expect a possibility of waiting (it's worth the wait though).
First thing is first, you have to order the grilled edamame. They are unlike any other edamame that you have ever tasted and will make you actually like to eat it! Other notable items on the menu that I pretty much always order whenever I go:
-Gyoza
-Miso soup
-Red Dragon
-Spicy Crunchy Rainbow roll
-***Scallop paradise (the best)
-Lime Scallop (amazing)
-Spider Roll
-Tempura Roll
There are a lot of other rolls you can order but these are my personal favorite rolls and items on the menu! They also have great lunch specials that give you a lot of food if you are into that sort of deal. The ingredients they use are top notch (you can just taste it)! Their service is so so. It isn't like omg WOW this is amazing but it isn't bad either. Really you're going for the food anyways so what does it matter? If you haven't been to Amakara you are missing out on the best sushi place in the bay area. Once you do go, you'll understand what I'm talking about. Words and pictures don't do this place justice. Trust me on this one and get here today!","5"
"Shekeba A.","Love this place!!!! Always has space and time and the food is really good. Best appetizer windjammer!! Try it you will thank me","5"
"Alina H.","Finally,I have found a great sushi place outside of San Francisco.
The place is happening and the atmosphere is fun.
The sushi is fresh and the menu is great.
It closes at 9pm and after 8 pm you can see fatigue set in some of the severs; which is not always fun.
I will definitely go there frequently.","5"
"Dan C.","The ambience of this place is perfect. One of the better sushi places in the area. Clean with fresh fish.
A lot of the other dinner plates are pretty amazing as well. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area.
Order the steak dinner if you're not going for sushi.","5"
"Mari A.","NEVER DISAPPOINTED. This excludes the wait. Come to the place expecting a line and you won't have anything else to complain about.
A few of the eats that I order:
- Sashimi Appetizer: always an order.
- Uni Sushi- if it's available. Why the H not?
- Steak and Eggplant: Steak is Rib Eye. Eggplant is seasoned well and grilled. I'll just stop there.
- Garlic Edamame: You'll never go back to regular Edamame again.
- Lychee Martini: LOVE
- Pomergranate Martini: LIKE. It's a nice teaser but the Lychee's the pleaser.
- Beef Teriyaki: Not what I usually order. But this is a staple for my dad and brother and I always catch myself stealing some. It's Rib Eye. CMON now.
- Spicy Tuna Roll: Delish and Fresh.
- Spicy Ramen: Noodles and broth so good, I didn't even notice there wasn't any meat or that the egg was overcooked. But because of those two items, I rate this a 4.
Some kindly advice: Get there by 5 PM or forget about it. Bring a book for the hour plus wait. And they don't take reservations.
Should you wait and you're not starving, it's worth it.","5"
"Theodore B.","New favorite sushi restaurant. Fresh seafood and amazing selection. I like costuming rolls which they have no problem doing. It is a busy location that I'll would wait for every day of the week.","5"
"Gregory Y.","Amazing sushi. Came up to the Bay from LA and usually go to Yoshi's but was unable to get an appointment. Decided to try this and wasn't disappointed.
Definitely on my list of restaurants to go to when in the Bay.
Good environment, not too uptight, great place for a date or to hang with some friends","5"
"Richie C.","I'm going to keep this short since there are a ton of other reviews.
The is restaurant is one of the most reviewed in the Dublin area and for the area, this restaurant gets 5 stars for the quality delicious food it provides. The place gets pretty busy, so try to make a reservation if you can. The restaurant is huge so it's able to accommodate a lot of people, so it's also good for large groups.
I've been here several times and the quality has been consistent. I've ordered the Chirashi bowls, Rainbow Rolls, sashimi salad, etc.. All of them were delicious and come with a decent portion of food. The fish and the ingredients are fresh and I would definitely come here to eat if I'm ever in the area.","5"
"Laila L.","This place it's worth the wait. Originally we got to the restaurant probably 30 minutes before they opened, since there are a few stores around the area we went to run some errands. It was our first time at the restaurant by the time we came back there was a big line of people waiting for them to open. We decided to make the line and surprisingly they started seating people quickly. Probably waited 20 mins to be seated but our food came quickly.
We ordered grilled edamame, some sushi rolls and spicy ramen. Grilled edamame a must try, sushi very fresh. I love the spicy ramen very tasty and full of flavor.","5"
"W Z.","This place is great and has wonderful vegetarian options. But make a reservation or show up very early they get busy quick.","5"
"Britanya S.","LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!!
everytime I've eaten here, Im full and happy.
very nice and accommodating staff as well","5"
"Sue R.","Must try...the charred edamame; the sashimi salad;
the grilled squid; the lemon/salmon roll - so fresh; all of the sashimi - especially the Hamachi; the Italian roll is terrific as well. Service on a Sunday after Christmas at 5 p.m. was great even though the place was packed within 10 minutes! Get there early.","5"
"MikSarj P.","Simply, delicious! Get there early as it get uber busy, I suggest to get there around 5.30pm, if possible to avoid a waiting time more than 30mins, having said that, they have a great bar waiting area as well.","5"
"justin s.","Waited about a Hour & 20 minutes but the food taste really good. Ordered 4 rolls and a appetizer don't know the names of them but they all taste good. I ordered the sweet raspberry iced tea and that even taste almost perfect! The customer service was great as well even though there busy!
This place is definitely worth trying if your in the Dublin/Pleasanton area.","5"
"Dave B.","This place rocks! Been here about 6 times and never been disappointed. Doesn't take reservations, so plan ahead to have a drink at the bar before being seated, or two if you come during rush hour on Friday or Saturday night, I've waited an hour for a seat. Great sushi and lots of fantastic rolls to choose from. The best edamame I have ever had.","5"
"Michele D.","Always delicious. Neighborhood feel. People recognize us when we arrive. Wish it wasn't so crazy busy & noisy but I guess that's the price we have to pay here for quality.","5"
"Audra C.","Our favorite sushi place in the Tri Valley and my favorite place for a Moscow Mule, oddly enough. Wait times are sometimes nuts, but the food never disappoints. A favorite for family, girls nights, or a date!","5"
"Sydney C.","Conveniently located near Stoneridge Shopping Center. We came here about ten minutes before opening and there was already a line outside the door. It eventually got longer as it got closer to 5pm. I have never seen a line for sushi, ever.
Given that it was also a Tuesday, one of the least busiest days of the week..this sushi place seemed to be pretty popular, which meant one thing, it HAD to be good. People weren't lining up for nothing, right?
We got seated pretty quickly. Requested to sit at the bar because wanted to watch the Warriors game. Got served hot tea and water upon request. Looked through the menu and saw that they had tons of options. They had the more common rolls on one page, like the dragon roll or California roll, but turn to the next page and you find yourself looking at a whole list of really unique rolls. We ordered the shrimp mango which was basically tempura, crab, mango, etc.. We also ordered the Hawaiian delight and this was my fave. Why? Because it tasted exactly like the maui zaui pizza from Round Table which I love so much. Sushi that tastes like pizza, whaaaaaaaat?! It had teriyaki glaze, smoked salmon, bacon, pineapple, etc. It had a tangy sweet/sour flavor to it, but it was perfect! Each specialty roll was around $12-16. The more common rolls were $8-10 and that's pretty normal.
I loved that we were able to sit at the bar and watch the sushi chefs do their thang!! :)
The place was very clean and dimly lit. The place started getting crowded 30 minutes after they opened so good thing we avoided the wait! Would definitely come here again, but only if I'm in the area!","5"
"Auden W.","Spontaneous trip to east bay only to find this spot on Yelp. Chilling around 430pm and wanted something to grub. Saw that this spot opened at 5pm so I decided to stop by. I read that the line would start forming before it was open and that was surely the case this time even on a Tuesday.
The line to enter at 5pm was at least 15 people long and we were quickly accommodated at the bar as requested to watch the Warriors game. #Dubation
As I was entering the restaurant, I could see that the spot was definitely more of a higher tier sushi restaurant. It was dimly lit and decorated with class. We end up ordering a shrimp mango roll and a Hawaiian delight which came up to be around $34 pre tip. I got to say that the Hawaiian delight tasted like pizza. It has such an unique taste to it that I have never had before. Pizza on a sushi roll? Now that's something you have to try. The bacon bits make it that much better too. The shrimp mango was also fabulous. Carefully crafted with love, it tasted very fresh. Although we stopped ourselves from more rolls, I got to say this spot is one I would I go back again to.
Although on the pricier end, if you're craving a little good stuff and don't mind dropping some bands, this sushi spot is for you. Hawaiian delight is a must especially if you're a pizza lover. Thumbs up!","5"
