"Jim H.","Five stars to Claudia for taking the time to explain why I was having a problem
with recent shipment charges.
On August 27th I noticed that 2 of my book shipments had exactly the same weight and the same expected delivery
dates even though they were 2 very different books going to opposite ends of the country. This struck me as either
an incredible coincidence or a possible problem with the post office computer system. Over the next few days I
noticed several other similar irregularities, one resulting in an overcharge of $2.50 on August 29th. I made
several attempts to get the postal employees to investigate and/or explain the problem but nobody seemed
to want to help. Then on September 2nd I explained the problem to Claudia. I could immediately see from
her expression that she understood the problem. She explained that when a customer has multiple shipments,
the clerk has 2 options to use when proceeding from one shipment to the next. The ""NEXT"" option is used when
all shipments are identical in every way, avoiding the need to weigh each one. The ""HOME"" option is used when
shipments vary in weight and/or destination. Since the ""NEXT"" option eliminates several steps, some clerks were
apparently using it more often than they should to save time, not realizing that weight differences were affecting
the shipping charges. I much appreciated the few extra minutes that Claudia took to explain everything in detail.","5"
"Eryn H.","Oh my gosh, I can see why Amakara has so many great reviews. At first, I was very turned off by the fact that there was going to be a one-hour wait for a dinner for two people on Saturday night, but we decided it must be worth the wait. We actually only ended up waiting about 20-30 minutes, which was a huge bonus.
We wanted to start the evening with some drinks and it took us a while to narrow down the huge selection of sake and wine. Eventually, we decided on the Hot House Sake. It was reasonably priced, and it went down very smoothly.
Per the server's recommendation, we went for the Fish Foie Gras roll, which was pretty interesting, but not in a bad way at all. The chefs were very generous with the foie gras. I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce they serve on the side - I thought the roll tasted better with regular wasabi and soy sauce. I also ordered the Lemon Salmon Roll, which was amazing! The salmon totally melted in my mouth, and the additional components of baby arugula sprouts and paper-thin lemon slices elevated the roll to a whole new, refreshing level. My only critique on the rolls was that the sushi rice tasted slightly undercooked.
The inside of the restaurant is beautifully modern. The only downside was that the tables were wobbly. The first table we were seated at was wobbly, and the second table we moved to wasn't much better. However, our server was extremely warm and friendly, and he made the experience awesome. I would give this 4.5 stars if I could, but given the absolute amazingness of the rolls, I'll round up. Will definitely be back sometime to try their other rolls (and drinks!).","5"
"Cameran A.","FAVORITE sushi place!! Had the watermelon mojito which was delicious and love the sashimi salad!","5"
"Wes G.","Hands down, best sushi in the area. Most days are booked with over an hour wait time so be sure to put in a reservation. Either way, well worth the wait! Staff very friendly and happy to accommodate any dietary restriction need. They have a full bar while you wait so if you come and have to wait for a table, their bartending staff will assist. Great bar area to chat with others as there are standing cocktail tables near the bar. Great food, fast service, highly recommend!","5"
"Kevin E.","This place is definitely a favorite of mine! I've been going for a few years, at least, and I keep wanting to go back for more.
Good:
*A couple of my favorite sushi rolls I always get are awesome, especially ""Klondike Express.""
*It's always buzzing with customers and has become a popular nightspot Friday and Saturday nights.
*Waiters and waitresses are very friendly and courteous.
*Love the bar, nice bartenders with a great happy hour... The sake bombs are awesome and I love the crushed ice they out in the sodas!
*Wonderful atmosphere with high ceilings and huge windows overlooking the outside.
*Great place to bring a date and/or your significant other.
Not-so Good:
*Their sushi options are plentiful, but lack a little bit in variety. I feel like my list of choices are getting smaller, and I'm ordering the same thing, because they're all so similar.
*The service could be a lot faster, as it seems that the waiters and waitresses disappear for longer than expected. The food sometimes takes a while to arrive at your table, too.
*Prices are kind of high, compared to places in the city that are of much better quality food and have more various options.
*Sometimes it gets a little cold there, especially if you're right under a vent. If you ask them to lower the air conditioner (or turn it in) they will.
Overall, I still love the place, because it's a fun spot and the sushi rolls I love are ones I really, really love! The issues I have with them are not enough to keep me away. I will definitely be going back again as often as I can!","5"
"Sharon P.","Hands down best sushi place around. Upbeat atmosphere, but you gotta get there early to get a table. There is always a line BEFORE the place opens. Best thing is the prices are reasonable and the food every so tasty!","5"
"Caroline R.","We went there to celebrate our anniversary and tried a variety of dishes. All were terrific. Make reservations, though!","5"
"Peter C.","Had a last minute in the plan and we decided to go to get some sushi. We found this awesome restaurant in pleasant and we sitting in front of the sushi bar checking out how the chef making sushi. Every time when the chef poo out ate sushi me you can tell is really really fresh it worth to try there and definitely will go back there again. At last the waitress is really really friendly.","5"
"Ashley L.","Love this place! This is my go to Japanese place in the tri valley area. They're always packed because he food is so delicious and service is great.
Highly recommend!","5"
"T L.","Best sushi hands down in the east bay! Have tried 6 other sushi houses but would only recommend Amakura-it has the best tasting and freshest sushi.","5"
"Hannah C.","Environment 5 + stars. Service 5 + stars
An American style Japanese restaurant ....... Food are not bad, just American style.","5"
"Camille A.","LOVE this place, but here's the twist: I'm allergic to seafood, however, Amakara has delicious alternatives and not to mention exemplary staff. The people here are incredible and not to mention extremely accommodating. I've had the Ramen twice now and though this might be a sushi restaurant, their ramen is top notch. I love Amakara, I'll definitely be back soon. Keep it up :)","5"
"Julie P.","Come to this place for a blind date. Even if your date drones on and on about the philosophical meaning behind his appreciation of women's breasts, asks you if you can share an appetizer because he's ""not that hungry"", excuses himself to the bathroom 5 times throughout the night, defensively puts his arm around you just as the cute waiter is asking you for your phone number, and walks around with the most self entitled attitude ever splattered on his butt ugly face....as soon as you get a taste of the ramen and the dragon roll sushi, I promise you, his face will become but a distant blur as you hop onto the Amakara Express to Paradise Island.","5"
"Chapman R.","Great quality and big portions. I'm used to paying higher prices for such a sushi meal. The sashimi pieces were quite large and the house special rolls were beautiful and tasty. We ordered enough for 3 people along with a couple beers and it was less than $90. Great deal. The place was packed which shows you the quality of the food. Would highly recommend.","5"
"Justin Y.","By far one of the best Japanese restaurants I have ever been to. Not to toot my own horn, but being Japanese, I know my food. If you don't mind waiting, I would suggest getting there at least 15 minutes before they open on the weekends. There will be a line, so if you miss the first group, you'll have to at wait at least an hour. Coming in anytime after 6pm on the weekend, you'll probably have to wait a little less, missing the first wave storm of people.
The best edamame that I have ever had, it was grilled and cooked in garlic. I've never had edamame prepared like that before, but I don't think I can go back to the plain flavor. Real crab in their California rolls automatically shows that the sushi will be good. Their chicken/beef teriyaki plates come with large portions and the quality is really good. I would highly recommend their sesame chicken.","5"
"Chris C.","Easily one of my favorite sushi restaurants. Great food, great service, and a very clean and modern restaurant. Coming is always such a treat and always satisfying. Favorite sushi: red dragon, fried california roll, spicy crunchy rainbow. Another favorite is the spicy ramen. It is amazing, one of the best ramens I have ever tried. Coming here, you would expect to leave with a smile.","5"
"Lindsie S.","Sushi was extremely fresh, tempura was to die for and teriyaki chicken was a great size and amazing. My husband and I came here for the first time tonight, we found this place on yelp and it did not disappoint whatsoever. Customer service was a 10 out of 10, and the presentation of the food was impeccable. We will be back.","5"
"Gretchen L.","Best Sashimi I've had. The fish is so fresh that it doesn't even taste fishy if that makes sense. Tastes like its straight from the water. Good portions and the rolls are to die for as well.","5"
"Dena M.","So after trying to get into this place a few times, I was finally able to see what all the rave is about. Everytime I came it was packed and had to wait a long time. Today I finally learned if you are a party of 6 or more you can make a reservation, I will be sure to keep that in mind.
So I ordered the green salad, which I loved with the sesame miso dressing. For appetizer the seared scallops served with spinach, and again it was delicious. Now to the good stuff.... sushi!!! Because I am pregnant I had to stick with the cooked stuff, and the waitress helped me with that and gave me some amazing recommendations. My favorite of them all was the mango shrimp, which I was not expecting. I also ordered Italian Dragon and Klondike Express. I enjoyed the three different flavors of tobiko on the Klondike Express, my daughter refered to it as candy because it looked exactly like that, green, red and yellow.
The service here was great, the waitress was very sweet and kind as well as accomodating to my every need. I will definitely be back to this place.","5"
"Maria L.","I love this place! Delicious food, great service and awesome sushi venue. My boyfriend and I love their sashimi platters which are always fresh and delicious! It's a great place for date nights especially if your significant other is a sushi lover. The ambiance is a bit more upscale but that's a good thing. This place is always packed so make sure you plan ahead!","5"
