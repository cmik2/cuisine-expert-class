"Jake P.","Randomly ran across Amakara while shopping across the street and was SO pleasantly surprised! Wow, between the awesome bartender/full bar, amazing customer service, and fantastic Sushi, this has turned into my go to for Sushi in the East Bay!!!","5"
"Someguythatlikestoeat n.","Spectacular! Edamame are delicious! three of a kind, wonderful! I go here at Least TWICE A MONTH. Wait staff excellent. If you like sushi, this place is a must. Oh, a 30 min wait is pretty standard, so just phone in your order if you don't want to wait, then go home and bliss out on extremely good food!","5"
"Michelle A.","Favorite place for Sushi in the Bay Area!","5"
"Gerald K.","Try the Red Dragon roll. Totally awesome! We sat at the bar. I was able to see our rolls made. Kinda cool btw. The guy behind the glass was funny and even gave our daughter some sweet eggs to try. If Im in the the neighborhood I will eat here again for sure!","5"
"sam k.","Amakara is my favorite spot for sashimi. I prefer sashimi over nigiri (nigiri is with the rice and sashimi is just the fish). Not only is the food fresh but very tasty as well. They prepare, cut, and serve the fish very well. Friends I go with enjoy all the rolls and appetizers. Fried edamame is bomb. For the most part the wait staff is very kind and quick unless it gets really busy.
Make sure you request a sake bomb from Joe or Eddy.
FYI - If you want to sit in front of the sushi chefs at the bar make sure you go early because it gets packed.","5"
"Dale C.","This place is my favorite sushi/Japanese restaurant in Tri-Valley. I've been to many but Amakara still has me coming back the most. If you come on Friday or Saturday evening, expect a long wait. On those days just arrive before the rush of the dinner crowd or just pick a different day/time.
I love their hamachi handrolls. Their fish is so much fresher than other places around this area. Also, I love their sesame chicken, grilled edamame (not steamed), and tuna ceviche salad. If you work around the area and come here for lunch, their lunch combo specials give you a lot of food for the price pay compared to their dinner menu.
Another plus, they have happy hour drink specials 5pm-7pm Monday - Thurs.","5"
"Todd C.","Best Sushi in the East bay- Great service...get there early as the wait gets long...but the food is the best! Friendly sushi chefs make amazing dishes","5"
"Holly L.","The sushi here is very good. The service is also great! I came with a group of 6 friends for a birthday celebration. They accommodated us by letting us put the surprise cake in their fridge and bringing it out when we asked them to. Also gave us some free dessert on top of that! We got a variety of rolls and had some edamame and miso soup before those came out.","5"
"Stephanie J.","My friend and I went here for a girls night out and had a great time! There drinks were amazing and the sushi was divine! I am in love with there Philadelphia Roll! I will definitely be making another trip here in the next few months!","5"
"Stephanie T.","When I go to any Japanese restaurant for the first time, I always get the ""basics"" --yes, I'm that person who establishes trust through familiarity-- so I ordered the mix sashimi plate, a sushi roll, and the spicy ramen (usually I'd go with the udon).
Beautiful sashimi plate with the expected variety and good sizes, but when the fish is fresh, the place is pretty much a winner in my book.
The special sushi rolls run between $10-15 depending on what you get, but the price is typical of any sushi place. What I did not expect was the portion, quality, and presentation. I don't remember the last time I saw a caterpillar roll with antennae and eyes! Sadly that roll belonged to the family next to me. We ordered the salmon spider chile roll which is basically a spider roll with salmon sashimi on top and a tangy chili sauce drizzled all over. Impressed? Yes.
Spicy Ramen. Huge bowl only for $9.50. The soup was quite spicy, not the kind that pinches your tongue, but one that makes your feel like you devoured a ball of medium flames--my fave.
Aside from the food, service was friendly, the lighting is slightly dim, so perfect for dates, families, groups, or just ""chilling"" at the sushi bar. I walked out a happy first-timer at this place and I am ready to try more things on their menu next time.
Last but not least, WATCH the sushi chefs do their thing, because that speed they put in and the results...mindblowing. Enjoy!","5"
"Tyler D.","If you're like most, you'll think its pretty hard to screw up sushi...and it is. But this place puts a spin on boring rolls with its Amakara Original rolls that are absolutely superb.
I used to be wary of sushi so i would just get terriyaki beef or chicken...don't bother. The Original rolls are too delicious to pass up.
The place gets crowded on weekend nights but just because it's that good.
The Original rolls are a bit pricey but they're the only reason why I eat here.","5"
"Venetia T.","This place is absolutely amazing!!Everything is fresh and so tasty. We already been there more than six times and its a must for us now!!When we think greatness Amakara is the first thing that pops up in our minds!!Thank you all for the great experiences. Try absolutely the grilled edamame ,the fried kalamari(sauce on the side if you down like it too salty), the tuna and shrimp cheviche (omg so fresh!!!), the sushi and sashimi Hamachi/Tuna/Unagi , scallop paradise , california rolls , tempura mix and I could go on and on.... Try it for sure!!!!","5"
"Bimal P.","Best sushi place in the tri-valley. The fish looks and tastes so fresh. Service is always great. They have a nice selection of nigiri. Their cooked food is good too. Agedashi tofu and beef wrapped asparagus are delicious! Be ready for wait... But so worth it.","5"
"Edmond G.","Regular; we're here at least twice a month. I wish it was less busy though :) Excellent quality fish, I've had every single fish listed on the menu or not.","5"
"Sam B.","Busy and a 30 minute wait but definitely worth the wait. We had 3 rolls, the best was the seared tuna roll.","5"
"Sue T.","Excellent food, cocktails and service. Price is reasonable - highly recommend it.","5"
"Scarlett W.","Bartender Tasha is superb. Worth waiting for a seat at the bar vs getting a table. Yes this place is always packed, but the food is great (plenty of non sushi options too). When we come here we know we are going to have to wait, and we know its going to be pricey (as sushi should be) but the whole experience is worth it. Especially when you're lucky enough to be there during Tasha's shift!","5"
"Dr. Scott R.","The food was really good. From the asparagus beef to the sushi rolls. Highly recommended! Wonderful food from start to finish.","5"
"Wrecks Q.","Been coming here since they opened and it's rewarding to see how popular they've become. Their service has always been attentive. Their food is imaginatively prepared and very delicious. The best smoked sake I had in my life, was something Jimmy claimed he smoked hours before serving. Their salmon skin hand roll is also topnotch! My favorite roll is the Hawaiian...c'mon it has bacon!!!!
If you're in the tri-Valley, Amakara is a must for your sushi needs!!!","5"
"Kimmylou C.","Excellent Food and Customer Service!!!
Came here on a very busy Saturday Night with my friend. Place was packed!!! Just so happens a seat opened up in the bar area so we decide to sit there. We were helped by the Manager Myly. She was excellent!! Very helpful and attentive. I understand that they were very busy, but she got the food to us very quickly!! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!! Would definitely come again.
