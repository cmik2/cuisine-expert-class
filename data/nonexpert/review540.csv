"Emily H.","Amakara is a GREAT sushi spot in Dublin. I am vegan so there aren't a TON of sushi options, but veggie sushi is delicious! You MUST get the grilled edamame, the BEST!
I always get their cucumber roll and asparagus roll which is tempura asparagus drizzled with teriyaki sauce and served with a salad.
They seem to always be busy, so expect to wait or go early, they open at 5PM for dinner.
Highly recommend though. Good service, not overly friendly, but the food makes up for it.","5"
"emily h.","We tried out Amakara for the first time and WOW were we impressed! We were initially told 30-40 minute wait, but a few people left and suddenly after 15 minutes we got a seat! I ordered the shrimp mango roll and it was one of the best rolls I've ever had! Being pregnant, I can only eat cooked rolls, which limits my choices--but this was amazing! The mixed tempura was also the best of any place in the bay area, super fresh and not too oily! My husband got the udon and he said it was the best of any place he's ever been (which is saying a lot--because he gets that at every japanese restaurant!). Definitely the best sushi in the bay area. A little pricey, but worth it!","5"
"Jeanette L.","Blown away by this local sushi spot! Grew up in the area and have never been WOW'ed by local sushi and this place really amazed me! Might be because I just recently watched Jiro Dreams Of Sushi but I have been craving sashimi in particular and Amakara definitely soothed the craving. Super fresh and very generous portions. And the rolls were fun and delicious too.
Definitely going to be my go to sushi spot when I'm in the East Bay!","5"
"Kamran A.","Awesome place!!!
Went to this sushi place because we found it on Yelp, last minute - Thanks Yelp! We had a birthday party dinner late at night and the food was incredible! Every dish/roll was properly portioned, eccentrically decorated and deliciously tasty!
I will definitely come back here again and recommend this place to anyone looking for a great sushi dining experience in the Dublin area.
Thanks again Yelp!","5"
"Alexandra D.","My new comfort food location!! Grilled edamame, Oyster shooter, and sashimi platter are a must!!!! Great happy hour and friendly speedy staff. Not to mention the quality of the food always being so consistent and of such high quality! Do note that although the hostess may say 30 min until seated be prepared to wait 15,(this happening several times in my experience here) the staff is quite efficient when it comes setting tables and having a constant flow of happy returning customers :) enjoi","5"
"Kenneth T.","Ta friend who works here recommended the sashimi salad which was superb she also recommended the spicy crunchy rainbow roll which was spectacular if you guys want a dish that will explode your taste buds get either of those dishes you'll love them trust","5"
"C M.","Super delicious. Believe the hype, its true! Most people rant and rave about their custom sushi and its true- everything I ordered was so good.
I ordered a sushi roll with tuna and it tasted a bit spicy and sweet. The sesame chicken dish was also mentionable - probably one of their staple entrees. Our server for the evening was a super friendly and outgoing character, so I had to give credit for the awesome customer service. The drinks were also good especially because Amakara has specialty Asian beers and even a happy hour! Go Amakara!","5"
"Andrea A.","It was delicious! I ordered Salmon Teriyaki, boyfriend got Chicken breast Teriyaki, & my brother & his girlfriend got some sushi rolls. The portions were amazing! I didn't get a tiny little sliver of fish & my boyfriend got an actual whole chicken boob! My brother, who actually eats sushi, said that their food was good too. Our server, Jonathan, was super nice, but also super busy(as were the other servers). They were all running around like chickens with their heads cut off, so I felt bad for asking for more sauce & drink refills.(I used to be a server so I get it) Jonathan even apologized at the end due to him being so busy. He told us to ask for him next time we go. Don't worry, we're definitely going back!","5"
"Jessica B.","BEST sushi I've ever had! Their grilled edammae has be spoiled, I don't think I could ever go back to simply steamed. This last time I went was probably my favorite! I recommend sitting at the sushi bar where the cooks are because it's a completely different experience and they are so fun!! I'm very picky when it comes to sushi because a lot of places has chewy seaweed (which means not fresh) and not always rolled but NOT THIS PLACE!! Always crisp and tight!! LOVE LOVE LOVE! Customer service is awesome and cocktails are always soooooo yummy and different. I really can't go any where else for sushi anymore. OH and try their spicy noodles :) great for cold nights.","5"
"Evan G.","We are here for the first time back in 2010 and have been regulars ever since. We hit this place up at least once a month because of how fresh the sushi is, how many specialty rolls they have, their cool cocktails, and amazing staff. When our friends come into town this is the place we take them all too. Amazing sushi. Potentially the best I've had in my whole life. Grilled Edamame & Hamachi Carpaccio for an appetizer. Red Dragon, seared sesame tuna, Klondike express, spider, jalapeño hamachi, and anything else we've ever tried has been nothing short of exceptional.","5"
"Steve T.","High quality sushi and fun place too. I had the best tasting soft shell crab I've ever eaten. Also one of the best amaebi shrimps I've ever had also. Clever rolls like scallops with lime and hamachi with jalapeño. I had the whole eel donburi and it was excellent. This place is loud and we were shouting and laughing like school kids.","5"
"Lorrie K.","I've come here multiple times with my boyfriend and each time they have yet to disappoint. We always get the Gyoza which are excellent every time. Then we usually get the ramen which is equally delicious, along with a roll to share. All in all I think this place is great and I can't wait to go again!","5"
"Shatil R.","The dragon roll was excellent and amber jack sushi was a succulent delight. The deluxe California roll, with real crab meat, was good, too.
Only disappointment was the tempura (fried) Philadelphia roll--it just tasted like a warm cream cheese filled tempura tube.
We got our food in about thirty-five minutes. Long wait, though in their defense, it was fairly crowded. Food was great.","5"
"Imagine T.","Forget best in Dublin we say best Japanese in the Bay Area, Yae Area whatever you want to call it.
Amakara is my favorite Japanese restaurant as of last night. It is just simply amazing. We got there at 6pm and it was super crowded. It was also Saturday so it wasn't too surprising. It was probably crowded so early due to daylight savings and it getting so dark so early now. Anyway, we weren't seated until 7:30. Which was a bummer.
We were kind of upset so we were quick to order because we were starved. They brought us our appetizers quickly and they were amazing. I have never tasted such good tempura it was flavorful it was unbelievable!!!
They then brought us our entrees which were so beautifully set up that you didn't even want to touch it. I ordered Spicy Ramen which had a boiled egg, corn, green onion, seaweed and I had them add chicken. If I could tell you I have never had something sooooo delicious in my life you wouldn't believe me. But seriously it was just that tasty. Best noodles I've ever had.
Others ordered fried tofu (freaking amazing)
Sushi, chicken teriyaki, perfect Japanese rice OMG I gotta stop writing this review I want some more right now!!!!
Bottom line go here!!!","5"
"Eve R.","Excellent food. Fun atmosphere. Large portions and a great menu with lots of variety. Staff were super friendly. The service was fast and accommodating to special requests.","5"
"Mo D.","Have tried many sushi places in the Bay Area and Sushi doesn't get much better than Amakara! Must try the grilled edamame. The Dragon Roll is also a fav! The wait for food can sometimes be a bit long, but I expect that with sushi restaurants especially when they are busy and good!","5"
"Paolo F.","Really long wait for a Saturday night in Dublin but the food is worth it. We spent about 2 hours on cumulative wait times alone. (An hour & 15 min for seating and 45 minutes for food.)
I also really wish that they could work on their customer service though. The hostess that night seemed very pressured and apathetic to our wait. Our waitress, though accommodating, was someone we had to actively seek the attention of. If we were dishing out $200 for a dinner, the overall customer care had better be top notch.
Other yelpers weren't kidding about the ample portions but they're fitting for what was being charged.
Wouldn't recommend the Italian Dragon Roll as much as the Klondike Express though.","5"
"Miho B.","Love this place. Honestly such fresh fish from Japan, and totally worth the price (which is a very fair price) service could be a little faster but still 5 stars for their food quality:)","5"
"Molly Q.","The best sushi in the area hands down! The place is constantly packed every day of the week and there is typically a long wait (30-45 minutes) before you can pick up your food when you order for pick up but it is worth it. So worth it!","5"
"Sunny J.","The absolute best sushi in the suburbs. The place is always packed and always worth the wait for a table. This is our go to sushi place. They will make you any type of specialty roll you can think, but the sashimi/nigiri are still the way to go.","5"
