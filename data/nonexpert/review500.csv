"Alexis F.","Amakara is always good and usually crowded. I've been several times but last night was the first time being quoted an hour wait time for 5. (They only take reservations for 6 or more).
After killing time at Paris Baguette..Cafe Tapioca and Ranch 99 we were seated.
Best rolls of the night=3 of a Kind and Italian Dragon.
Grilled Edamame was a crowd fav.
I always get Ramen (Miso) but it was only meh this time. Maybe I caught them on a bad broth night.
It's loud enough to drown out any outbursts from my kiddos and the wine/sake menu has plenty of choices.","4"
"Y. Abigail H.","Amakara...
I wish I could say how much I enjoyed their food...
A friend and I came here to eat on a Saturday evening.. I had seen the reviews and was excited to finally try their sushi!!
We got here around 8:15pm on a Saturday evening. It was crowded and there was a line; we put our name down on the list and the hostess told us it'll be approximately 30 minute wait. No biggie, we figured it's s sign this place is good.
8:55pm - got called to get a table. They walked us to the table by the window - I first noticed that the menus on our table were dirty - had stains all on the cover and in them. Then, we noticed that the table itself was sticky. Then, I noticed that the plates on the table were dirty. The top one had a stain, the one on the bottom was really dirty, almost as if they didn't even bother to put it the wash. We asked a waiter to exchange the plates - he acted as if it wasn't a big deal that the plates were dirty to begin with. Funny enough, two ladies got seated after us at a table on the left to us and noticed the same things about the dirty menus, tables, and plates... Yuck.
We ordered an appetizer (plain edamame) and sushi rolls (Cali roll and deep fried Cali roll) right away because we were both hungry and had been craving sushi. Appetizer came. But the sushi never came. I was facing the kitchen door and kept seeing waiters and waitresses bring out plates with delicious and fancy-looking rolls...to other tables though. The folks who were waiting in line before us - they got all their orders. The two ladies that were seated after us (at the table on my left) - they got their orders. The family that was seated on the right of us - they had finished a whole feast and meal and their waiter kept coming back to ask if they want more food.
By 9:45pm - our waitress comes to our table to assure us that our rolls are coming. Then she tells us that we if we wanted to put in any more orders we had to let her know immediately because the kitchen is about to close (restaurant closes at 10pm). We told her that we probably won't need to order anything else since, but we just want our rolls. She walks away. 5 minutes later, I see waiters still bringing out rolls to other tables. We're somewhat confused about why our orders is taking a long time - seeing as they're simple/basic rolls.
10:05pm - we still hadn't gotten our food yet. Decided to wait 5 more minutes before leaving the restaurant. By this time, I wasn't even hungry no more - it's so late already and I really just wanted to go home and sleep.
10:10pm - food never came - put money on the table for the appetizer and walked out.
I'm not trying to instigate or anything, but we were the only patrons with melanin complexions... I'm not sure if they intentionally chose to ignore us, or if it truly was a mistake. I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt.. I might consider giving them another try if I'm in the area...","1"
"Carolen M.","Could have been a better experience, but glad I had great company to spend it with. So what went right and wrong?
I arrived at Amakara at 6pm. It's located in this little plaza with various other restaurants, shops, including Cafe Tapioca. There's plenty of parking but it does get fairly packed near Amakara. I thought 6pm, it shouldn't be too crowded but BAM it was packed. All tables full, bar seats taken by folks waiting for a table. It was insane. Well our party of six was basically trickling in from either work or workout activities so we weren't really rushing for a table. The interior is fairly large with a large sushi bar in the center back, lots of 4 seater tables, etc. The hostess came to us at one point saying that our table had folks ready to pay so we would be seated fairly soon. Well...let's just say we waited....waited....waited...and well let's just say half an hour past until the host again told us that our table was given to a party that had reservations and seated them first. I'm like...really? Well we then finally got seated an hour later since I arrived and well we were ready to order let's just say.
Our server was nice and took our orders quickly. He even gave us happy hour prices for the sake bombs we ordered as a kind gesture and he also suggested a pitcher after we decided to up the order from 1 to 3 as he said it would be cheaper. Score! So not too shabby. I just finished a 3 day cleanse and so I wanted to ease my food eating and avoid fried or things full of rice so when I saw the Sashimi Salad, I was golden. So as the drinks came out, my friends had completed some merriment around that. Then one by one our orders came, but funny enough my order, which was probably the most simplest out of everyones orders, came out dead last and that was approximately 45 minutes after we ordered. The last thing I ate was a few walnuts after a workout at 5pm. I was HUNGRY...no no...HANGRY! So as my other friends finished their meals I was scarfing mine down and ended up catching up to my couple gal pals who nosh slowly.
The Sashimi Salad was large and in charge. It had about 16 slices of sashimi that included salmon, tuna, seared tuna, octopus, yellow tail, albacore, scallop, and crab meat. Fairly generous portion for $17. There was a light dressing which was pretty good for wiping my sashimi on the plate to dress with as well as a few capers and pine nuts. The fish was fresh though the slices were not all the same and not sliced properly, it still looked pretty. I contemplated taking half of it home, but at this point I was just shoveling it in in hopes to satiate the monster within.
Well we got our bill and our server was kind enough to split it 6 ways on credit cards. He was definitely awesome but not too awesome though! My water was never refilled and I was so parched and today was a really hot day! I downed two glasses of water as soon as I got home.
Our meal finally ended at 8:30-ish and the place was still busy. I guess for being known as the ""best sushi"" in the area, there's a reason why though for me, if I'm ever in the area and need sushi and I need to go to this place...I would order to go or make sure to get reservations for larger groups. The food itself is ok. The service was awesome to awful. Therefore overall it got 3 stars.","3"
"Lloyd S.","We've been to Amakara multiple times, but this is my first review. We walked in on a busy Monday night, but honestly what night isn't busy here?! A table was a little tough to get without reservations, but we were immediately sat at the sushi bar, which suits us just fine. We had the shrimp mango roll, spicy crunchy rainbow roll, some salmon, yellowtail, and tuna sushi, and of course, the grilled Edamame. The rainbow roll, sushi, and Edamame, were all absolutely delicious. The shrimp mango roll was good as well, but it had a little fishy aftertaste. Overall, it's really hard to have a bad experience here. I would definitely recommend making reservations if you're looking for a table, but the sushi bar seems to flow quickly and the bar is always a good option as well. Kumpai!","5"
"Theresa T.","This is by far my favorite sushi restaurant, ever. The quality of the fish is best in class and everything always tastes so fresh. Not only are the dishes presentable, but they taste great. The rolls are a good size as well and won't leave you hungry.
Make sure you order the grilled edamame as an appetizer! It's like no other.
A bit on the pricier side, but definitely worth it.","5"
"Morgan Y.","Best sushi place EVER!! Just thinking about their cocktails and food is making my mouth water. Take my money now!","5"
"Vicki L.","Amakara is like a mix of a Japanese restaurant infused with an American style dive bar. I say dive bar because they play the sports channel on their large TV screens and you have guys screaming and shouting at the TV (you can hear them from across the restaurant). The atmosphere and interior design felt more like a Western chain restaurant than an authentic Japanese place, so I didn't know what to expect with the food.
""Three of a Kind"" Sushi Rolls (with hamachi, tuna, salmon)- Really good and fresh salmon. Tuna wasn't bad either. Barely any hamachi.
""Shrimp Mango"" Sushi Rolls- Meh, the mango didn't taste fresh. The avocado slices were really good though.
Chicken Teriyaki- Tasted like they left it out for a while before serving it to us. Stale, hard, dry, and cold. Had one bite and did not eat the rest.
I don't like the rice that they use here. They use long grain white rice instead of the waxy short grain glutinous rice. The long grain tastes dry and doesn't stick to the sushi rolls the way it should. It really makes a difference. Made the sushi overall disappointing.
Bathrooms are kind of nice though. +1.","3"
"Lilia L.","I've went there a couple times, the food is okay I think it just doesn't suit my tastes","3"
"Alison L.","Delicious, fresh sushi. My friend and I came here on a Monday around 6:30pm and were seated immediately.
We got:
Mixed vegetable tempura
Okra tempura
Grilled eggplant miso soup
Dragon roll
Tempura roll
And my favorite.. Tamago!
Everything tasted great. The tempura had a flavorful batter and was freshly fried. The fish melted in my mouth. The California roll beneath had real flavor instead of the too common ones that just taste like mayonnaise. The tamago was excellent!! Six pieces come in the sashimi and they were soft, sweet, and perfect.
5/5 - I definitely recommend and will be back.","5"
"Natalie H.","I guess maybe I'm used to San Francisco sushi ..? We were definitely excited to try this place, but our mistake for going on a Saturday night at 6:45. They told us 45-1hr wait, but it ended up being 1.5 hours. Date night spoiled already. I guess ""organized"" (if even that?!) chaos would be an accurate descriptor of this loud, zero ambiance, haphazard service restaurant best for bigger groups than a one-on-one date. We were hangry by 8:15, and knew if we didn't order the second we were seated we'd miss our chance so we just picked a few random tried and true items. I will say the grilled edamame was delicious and I ate more of that than anything else. Tempura was tasty but nothing special. Sushi was a little disappointing. I would say the California roll inner was a little grainy, and the rolls were terribly dry (over cooked rice? Needed sauce?) so yeah, we won't be back especially since we drove out of our way to come here.","3"
"Zay R.","Everything you order at this place is delicious !!!
I love the edemame... the sushi... the pot stickers.... the beer I can go on
I also love the teriyaki chicken","5"
"Ty S.","The best sushi in the Bay Area ! Everything is delicious. The grilled oysters with pesto and cheese , the mango shrimp roll , and the dragon roll are my favorites","5"
"Daniel C.","First time here, and yes we were greeted by a wait list (1 hr but actual was 45 min) and a packed seating area and bar. The place had a festive, sports bar like ambiance. We skimmed the menu and noticed they serve contemporary Japanese, which to me means cuisine with a twist. Overall I give 4.5 stars rounding up to 5. Food quality, service, ambiance all outstanding despite the brutal wait.
I started with the Night Owl cocktail, which had passion fruit syrup, and the caffeinated vodka with Red Bull. They forgot the umbrella but the drink was great and refreshing.
We split the octopus and cucumber salad which had pickled seaweed, lots of cucumber, and just a few pieces of tender octopus (tako). Not bad, but wasn't too memorable.
Wife got the tonkatsu (lightly fried pork) with a tangy gravy on this huge platter of sushi rice and shredded lettuce. Pork was cooked perfectly - crispy skin, tender meat, and hardly any grease. Rice was seasoned and good, but salad was dry and lacking.
I got the combo sushi (choice of basic roll and five pieces nigiri) and an Italian Dragon roll. The Italian Dragon roll should be in the ""what were they thinking category"" but the flavors worked for me. Imagine a dragon roll but with some pesto sauce and topped with a sliced tomato marinated with a hint of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Talk about bold! Sushi otherwise perfect with melt-in-your mouth fish and loosely packed rice.
We will come again for sure, but take Yelpers advice and come here early, like just before opening.","5"
"Jon X.","Pretty crowded usually but overall great food and decent sized servings for a mid priced sushi place. I don't know what happened with their health ratings but I'd say I feel comfortable eating here","5"
"Sam N.","It's a cool place to come for lunch/dinner. It does get loud a bit but nothing too bad. The wait is extremely long and they have no system in letting people know when's their turn. It would be nice to have a ""chip"" or some sort of alert signal other than yelling people names when their table's ready.
But of course this isn't something that would keep me away but it's something for the restaurant to look in to and make a change.... and for those that would like a more quiet lunch/dinner I wouldn't say this is the place.
There's plenty of parking but giving the place location (in a plaza with dozen + other businesses) parking gets pretty full.
If you're one of those that care for their car I would park across the street (wells Fargo parking )
The food was good.
This was my first time here looking forward to going again. Until then I leave you all with 3 star review:)","3"
"Ashley L.","Love this place! This is my go to Japanese place in the tri valley area. They're always packed because he food is so delicious and service is great.
Highly recommend!","5"
"Judy L.","The locals were talking about how good this sushi place is so we decided to give it a try. Our hostess originally told us that the wait would be around 30 to 40 minutes but we were sat within half that time.
I have noticed that the chairs they use is big wooden chairs, something you would see at a steakhouse. The whole restaurant itself was dark besides the sushi bar with ample lighting. The table we got sat at was extra dark because the light was out and the hostess was not able to do anything about it, hence no photos because our table got pretty dark.
Shrimp Ceviche - this came with homemade tortilla chips which were great! The ceviche to chip ratio was off and they charge for chips if you want more. The ceviche was very limey with shrimp, cucumbers, peppers, mangoes which was decent.
cherry blossom - This was my favorite roll! The roll was wrapped in tuna as the flower petals and inside the roll was just avocado and salmon. Great amount of fish and avocado. Couldn't be happier!
spicy soft shell crab roll - This roll was very dull. It was pretty dry too. Anything that has soft shell crab should come with crab imitation or some sauce. They topped this roll off with purple onion.
spicy crunch rainbow roll - The spicy shriracha sauce on this roll will get you! I can handle spicy but this was pretty darn spicy! So ask for sauce on the side just in case.","3"
"Megan C.","Decided to try this place out after hearing good things from family and friends. Came here on a Tuesday evening around 7:30PM. The place was a lot more crowded than I would expect on a Tuesday night, but we only waited around 15-20 minutes for a table for 2. The servers and staff were friendly, but the service did not blow my socks off.
We ordered two miso soups, a Tropical Punch roll, a Combination Sushi dinner (with spicy tuna rolls), and a mixed tempura dish. The miso soup was good, not overly salty but had enough flavor. The TP roll was pretty... okay, nothing special. We ordered it because it was on the ""Amakara Originals"" menu, but in hindsight I wish I had ordered a different roll. The Combo Sushi dinner was okay: the fish didn't taste super fresh and wasn't anything special. And the mixed tempura had a light batter that wasn't too heavy but still had enough crunch. And yet again, it was okay, nothing special.
Without tip, our dinner ended up being over $25 per person. For the price, I expected the food to be pretty good, but was left pretty disappointed for how expensive this place is and how low the quality is for the price. Will not be returning here again.","2"
"Annastasia L.","I really don't understand why this restaurant is so popular. It's I guess more of an Americanized Japanese Restaurant. I've been here a couple of times and I think the food here is really sub-par. There are other Japanese restaurants in Dublin that are so much better.","2"
"Meriam M.","This is one Sushi restaurant you won't want to miss if you are here in Dublin.
I would have given them a 4 star but their customer service is slow and they are not attentive. For paying this higher cost and loyal returning customers - Customer service should improve. Especially during lunch hours.
Onto positive things. The sushi's are fresh. I love the variety of the bento box. Seriously one of the restaurants that offer variety but you pay extra. Very generous portion! I don't mind that. I love their edamame. It's roasted and salted. Must have! They've got a great sushi roll selection. Klondike Express and Three of a kind are great to try! Hand rolls are great!
The atmosphere is very updated/contemporary. We normally come for work functions. I'm not excited about the small room they try to cram us in but at least accommodating in a short period of time.
Overall - good sushi place. They just need to up their game on Customer Service.","3"
