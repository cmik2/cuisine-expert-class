"Billie L.","This is one of the best sushi places around. The cocktails are great especially the acai berry one and of course the sushi! I have tried almost every roll on the menu and I have yet to complain about any of them! It gets very busy around lunchtime but there are always seats since the place is so spacious.","5"
"Bryan L.","This is one of my top five favorite sushi joints in Cali. I've tried a majority of the appetizers and sushi but my goto dishes are always the mixed sashimi, uni, and amaebi. The fish is fresh, very generous portions, and presentation is great. Expect to pay at least twice as much anywhere else for the same quality and portion. The uni here is by far my favorite. I have never seen such large individual slices of uni. Most places will serve you a slice the width of your thumb. The uni here is twice the size and the same price. The mixed sashimi is another must try dish, $25 and typically about 20-22 pieces of tuna, scallop, salmon, mutsu, escolar, mackerel, octopus, halibut, and yellowtail. Most of the nigiri sushi is $5 for 2 pieces. So do the math... I feel like I making money each time I order it.
Just a few tips:
- It's always crowded so expect a little wait
- If you're coming by yourself, sit up at the bar, it's usually a much shorter wait and all the sushi chefs are super friendly
- During the weekdays, best time to come is towards the end of happy hour, between 6:30 - 7:00pm
- During the weekdays, if you're coming with 2 or more people, make a reservation
- I don't think they take reservations on the weekends, so just come early","5"
"Dee S.","Made reservations for our party of 11 and the host told us we would get the party room in the back. Once the day arrived and we showed up, they did not recall that comment, but luckily the room was still available for our use (drama diverted!). The room itself is not a VIP experience it is pretty much a storage closest converted into a room with a tv/stereo hook up and random height tables lining the sides of the walls so your party would have to sit in one big U form. We didn't mind and after moving some tables around we made it work. We were just glad to have the space and be loud as we want without disturbing other patrons. We ordered just about everything on the menu, but the highlights were:
-Chili Spider Salmon Roll
-Lime Scallop Roll
-Red Dragon Roll
-Three of a Kind
-Golden Shrimp Roll
-Spicy Ramen (AND OMG is it spicy)
-Katsudon/ Katsu
-Grilled Endamame!
-Otokoyama Junmai cold sake!
Our group was treated well and our food came in an orderly fashion. The wait staff was attentive in refilling our drinks and most of all not freaking out when we split the bill among 4 credit cards. Thank you Amakara, you have fulfilled my sushi cravings and will look forward to coming back very soon!","5"
"Tung T.","Never in my life would I have thunk that I would find a sushi place that I would enjoy in the Tri-Valley. (3 ""would"" and counting).
I came here for lunch with my coworkers one day and although we didn't pig out, the three rolls that we ordered left us super satisfied. Like a shower after you've been wearing the same underwear for a whole week. Like eating a nice chocolate chip cookie after enjoying 1 too many broccoli florets. Like working out after you've been convincing yourself not to since you woke up. Like....ow my brain hurts.
Simply put. I enjoyed Amakara so much I even brought it home for my family the same Sunday. And what the heck, I don't buy them food. They're suppose to buy me food! See how spoil I am? But Amakara was so good that I had to break out of my comfort zone. That speaks volume. I'm so spoiled that when I finish cooking my own food, I don't even put water on the pots and pans to soak up the grease. So spoiled that when my parents got me the black iphone 5, i made them return it for the white one (jk that never happened).
On the real, I like Amakara because not only can I enjoy my traditional Japanese dishes done well, but fusion excitement as well. My favorite rolls by far:
Hawaiian Delight - Smoked salmon roll with fresh mangos, tomatos, and perfectly fried bacon pieces! It's surprisingly great. I know you're probably thinking in your head, this fool knows nothing about sushi. Maybe I don't, but I enjoyed this roll and that's all that matters.
Scallop Lime - The most refreshing thing I have ever put in my mouth. It was like biting into Half Dome during sunrise. Fresh raw scallop served simply with a thin slice of key lime on top. Perfection.
Besides that, get the grilled edamame, you won't be disappointed. The wait can get super long, especially on weekends. Make reservations, although warning: there phone line is always busy. So good luck and godspeed!","5"
"Chris K.","This place is an easy 5/5. Maybe a 6?
Pros: 1) large, pretty rolls. Pretty as in well presented. Go top chef!
B) happy hour specials are great. Cheap apps and drinks until 7pm.
III) nice & clean. I've eaten at 'great' dirty, grungy stinky sushi places (yuk) to know the ambiance and cleanliness means a lot. If the front office is clean, I assume the back office (kitchen) is also. Ok maybe not 100% but if dirty in front how bad is the kitchen and food prep best practices?
d) helpful, friendly staff. A crucial component to any dining experience.
5) back to the awesome rolls. Heaps of fresh fish and plenty of special rolls that aren't your typical 'special rolls' (ie California roll, etc). Try their spicy rolls with jalape√±os.
Cons: I'm reaching here...
UNO) no outdoor seating. When possible I like to eat outside. Can't here.
2) Bar are is small and usually the napkin folding, table prep area for the staff.
III) it's not bike riding distance for me (as in cruiser - it's road bike distance)
See I'm reaching.
This place is a must try and must become a regular. Oh, not to mention the Passport Unlimited card works here #20%off I want to say the wife and I spent under $50 last time for dinner. That ain't bad for a sushi date night!","5"
"Sophia Y.","Finally a high-quality sushi restaurant in Pleasanton/ Dublin that doesn't overuse creamy sauces or cream cheese in its rolls. They mostly let the freshness of their seafood do the talking. With more of a classy restaurant feel to it, it's perfect for those birthday celebrations or dinners with colleagues.
Two tips: Come with patience and never surpass the chance to order the grilled edamame (or their sashimi, which makes this three tips...).
Wait time can be very long during the usual meal rush hours (but especially during dinner time). Make reservations accordingly. The noise level can get really loud during busy times also. I could barely hear the person sitting next to me. We were practically shouting. The staff are not the friendliest; some of them can be strictly business or hard to track down. Your water glass will be empty many a times. But the food makes up for it all.
If you love barbecue, you'll love the charred taste of grilled edamame. So salty but so worth it. The poke tuna, seared scallops, and agedashi tofu are also excellent choices for an appetizer.
My favorite rolls have been the cherry blossom, tropical punch (spicy!), and the spicy crunch rainbow. The lime scallop was pretty good too but too much lime and too sour. The sashimi is so buttery and fresh!
The open bar seating is good for informal dinners when you don't want to wait for a table. Happy hours are from 5-7 M-Th, but the only discount you get is the draft beers being half off. Nevertheless, try their flavored sake; my favorite is in apple.","5"
"Sandra F.","Best sushi place I have been to! Everything is fresh and it's worth the wait!","5"
"Sarah Robin S.","This place is the BEST sushi place over ever been to!
I came with a group of nine people for a friends birthday. Believe me, we ordered A LOT of food.
Our server Jon was very patient with us, and very polite. Although the place was really busy, he didn't keep us waiting. He also helped us split the check four different ways even though it was going to take some time.
Keep in mind, the lime scallop is VERY sour. But that should be obvious. I guess my friend wasn't really thinking. Lol
The food is GREAT. We all finished everything! And we pretty much ordered a feast.
My personal favorite was the scallop paradise. Worth every bite for the little pieces you get!
Their mixed sashimi special is pretty pricy, but what sashimi isn't pricy? The items on that plate is huge though, and it's soooo worth it!
I will definitely be returning!","5"
"Valentin V.","Best sushi east of the bay. Period.
Service is mehh but I don't care for that as much as I do for the freshness and quality of the food, especially when it's sushi.","5"
"Chantelle L.","I truly love a good sushi house, and for Dublin, this is as good as it gets! The service is so consistent and even though the lunch rush here is no joke, I always get seated within 10 minutes. That may be due to my propensity to sit at the sushi bar, but it really is the best seat in the house. These chefs are artists! It's so cool to watch their knife skills as they carve a lemon into paper thin slices, rind and all, as if it were butter. I had lunch here today with a co worker and we were both having a grand old time watching the chefs make our meals. I had the Tako Kimchee Salad (I had an inexplicable craving for octopus today) and a Lemon Salmon Roll. Both were prepared right in front of me, and let me tell you, they were works of art! The roll was arranged to look like cherry blossom flowers and the salad was so colorful and beautifully arranged. It's true what they say- you eat with your eyes first! And man, is that fish fresh! On several occasions I have seen them butchering a whole tuna or salmon in the back, and today I got to experience a giant bowl full of whole octopus get placed on the sushi bar inches from my face. The chef was joking around, jiggling them at customers at the bar. It was octopus overload and I loved every second of it!","5"
"Sarra E.","Best sushi in town

"Eva S.","Best sushi around by far, fresh, delicious, clean and great service. Can't ask for more.","5"
"Shawna P.","Really good food. I ordered a chicken teriyaki bento box. Everything was really fresh. I didnt get a chance to try the miso soup since i ordered take out, but everything else i ordered was bomb. Best tempura ive had in a long time!","5"
"Mary S.","I took my four year old out for her first sushi experience...and couldn't have picked a better place!! We sat at the bar and watched our rolls being made. The waitress noticed my daughter struggling with the chopsticks and make her ""training"" chopsticks...too cute! My daughter was thrilled and is now a sushi lover ...she especially liked the ""berries"" (tobiko) on top. : ) Will be going back.","5"
"David H.","Awesome, awesome experience. Amakara is clearly one of the finer sushi establishments in the San Ramon-Dublin-Pleasanton area. The service and food here is top notch, with an excellent attention to quality and variety. You can also buy sake bombs for the chefs, to thank them for their delicious creations! My favorite item on their menu is the giant sashimi platter (i say platter as it is a giant serving of top shelf quality fish), and they also have delicious rolls (dragon roll, I'm looking at you). Overall, the food here is of great quality, well priced and delicious. You can't go wrong!","5"
"Woody W.","Yet another wonderful meal at Amakara's. ""SPARK"" was our waiter and helped with a great recommendation of a chili spider salmon roll. Plus some salmon sashim, our favorite Red Dragon, and a hawaiann delight rounded out our meal.
Also the drinks were great, we have had sweettart martini, Neo Tokyo Tea, and Blackberry sage kamikaze.
Great job guys, AGAIN","5"
"Katherine F.","Amakara has reliably strong sashimi and a lot of good rolls, especially the Chili Spider Salmon.
Get there early if y don't have reservations. It fills up quickly on Fridays.","5"
"Brandon D.","My previous review only discussed lunch and this was when they were newly open. Now after almost 5 years of coming here, I can say that they've still got it. It's bittersweet that the place has become so popular; on the one hand it's nice that it's successful, but on the other hand it's almost always crowded, even on weeknights. I remember once a few years ago I came here with my mom and we both looked tired/miserable for whatever reason. The owner then came to us and offered us free grilled edamame because we looked so sad!
Without hesitation I always get the spicy seared sesame tuna. It has never failed me; the spiciness levels are where I like it, the roll has a nice crunch, and the asparagus is an unexpected but welcome addition. I keep telling myself I need to try a new roll, but it's so hard to change now. This place isn't for you if you're looking for more traditional sushi offerings; most of their rolls experiment with non-traditional ingredients. Everyone complains about the constant crowds, so I like to come during happy hour (and right at the start of it, too). I usually get the draft Kirin ($3 or $4 during HH) and it doesn't disappoint.","5"
"Timothy C.","I'm fond enough of sushi, but I wouldn't know a thing about being a sushi snob. I think that the reason many white people start eating sushi is because of peer pressure, and that probably 20% of sushi restaurants in the US just prey on white people trying to prove that the are cultured to their friends, and then the friends trying, and then liking sushi to impress people around them.
Well, Amakara is not preying on anyone. People go there because the food is delicious, and it happens to be sushi.
Top Dog - Scallop Paradise - I don't know what they did to that scallop, but it should be illegal! Topped with some herbs, a perfect, not-chewy texture, and I think a bit of lemon slice on top, it really gives you the flavor you wish all your prior scallops had.
Contender - Almost all the other sushi we had - I'll explain the almost later, but my brother ordered for us, and I don't know what he ordered, but every new roll that came out on one of those 2-foot long platters was delicious from the presentation to the fresh seafood to the unique (for sushi) ingredients such as jalapenos, scallions, tomatoes, and red onions.
Surprising - Grilled Edamame - I wouldn't ever choose edamame, but they grill it after bathing it in oil and spices and, well, if you're gonna have edamame, then have it here.
Disappointing - I thought a certain sushi roll sounded good, ordered it, and it wasn't the same as all the others. It had red onions across the top, but not in a good way like the other roll that had red onions on it. It was really just a classic case of brother jealousy where I wanted to prove I could order sushi better than my younger brother and I was TAKEN DOWN! Ouch.
I hears there is always a wait, but the wait is well worth it. We ended the night with some tempura ice cream, and went home with bellies full and hearts content. Thanks Amakara.","5"
"Angela L.","Woops, I added a ton of photos and completely forgot to write a review for this place.
Amakara's menu is Japanese food fit for their regional clientele (read: white folks). It's not super authentic Japanese food, but if you just accept that, it's fantastic. The dishes are innovative and delicious, and if you're more adventurous and enjoy sashimi, this place has some of THEEEE best sashimi I've had in the East Bay. We usually order the tuna poke appetizer, which comes on wonton chips. Last time we sat at the sushi bar, and the chef made us a shrimp ceviche. Not sure if that's on the menu, but it was very yummy. The ankimo is also nice and creamy here. My parents and I aren't much of roll people, but we've shared one a couple of times and it was very good.
The sashimi is the real winner here. Always fresh, and the hamachi is especially good. If you're on the fence because of prices, they also have a pretty sweet happy hour!","5"
