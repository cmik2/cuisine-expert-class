"Alex O.","Good lord. This place is loud!
Food is pretty good too. But I find it hard to enjoy a meal here, due to the volume inside.
It's a bit pricy as well.","4"
"Arj T.","I love Amakara. Used to come here frequently back in 2015,2016 . Visiting 1st time in 2 years brings back memories. Cant wait to devour my Hawaiian sushi.","4"
"Adam T.","I have always been an adamant sushi lover, and Amakara never seems to disappoint me. Whenever I am in the area I will always go to Amakara, their sushi and service is of the utmost quality. I am always happy to dine here.","5"
"Joe T.","What a rude arrogant person behind the bar who served our meal. I don't know his name but I will steer clear of his service if we ever go here again. Table service with a tip would have worked over this ass. Good food and atmosphere ruined by someone who talks before they think about what is being said. We were never out of line just showed up, ordered, ate, and paid for a meal. This Asian male simply speculated events at us as if we cared.
Looked like he had some control over the place as he directed traffic. Thanks for making us feel unwelcome. Nice way to treat a guest.","1"
"Alice C.","Came here for dinner on a Tuesday night with friends. Wait time was half an hour which was decent. Food was pretty good, but prices are definitely high at this place. Was apprehensive of paying with my card here despite the bad reviews related to card use. Checked my bank activity and so far so good.","4"
"Doug H.","Good Sushi here, a bit expensive - but definitely one of the better sushi spots in the bay area outside of the city.","5"
"Joe B.","First time at this place. Was busy at lunch time so I'm guessing people must like it!
Was greeted promptly and took a seat at there sushi bar. Good menu, placed my order and it was about 15 mind for food to arrive not to bad with how busy they were.
I will definitely come back for seconds!!","5"
"Mina T.","Came here on a Friday night at prime time around 7:30. The wait was about 40 minutes so my husband and I waited near the bar and ordered a drink. The bartenders were quick to take our order - I'd recommend the Amakara Cocktail for anyone who likes a fruity cocktail that is not too sweet. Our waiter for the night was James and he was quick to take our order and helpful if we had any questions. The sushi was delicious and the ambiance of the restaurant makes it for a nice spot to check out!","5"
"Steve L.","Delicious food, and great drinks with good service. Be prepared to wait for a table if you come in during peak dining hours. The wait is well worth it though. I love the creativity they put into the custom rolls and the craft they put into the cocktails. Great place for a date night or an outing with the gang.","5"
"Tee n Em K.","We love this place. Everyone else does too...so it can get busy. Great sushi! Great Japanese dishes! Great happy hour draft prices! Highly recommend!","5"
"Angela L.","I have eaten here for four weeks in a row, and have tried various selections of their food. With that said I can give an honest well rounded review.
First the hostess needs to learn how to give a proper estimation of wait time. We came everytime on a busy Friday night, and the wait would always be ""30-45min"" as said by the host. Realistically is would be over an hour. They should over estimate for reassurance.
Second it is a pretty good food selection, from grilled meats and seafood, fried food, salads, rolls, and meat entree plates.
The sushi rolls are good. But most sushi rolls in other restaurants are good since it's packed with different sauces, toppings, and fried tempura.
HOWEVER the sashimi and the nigiri is awful. It's not good quality sushi rice. And it is also not good quality fish. It's not worth the steep price.
Don't bother the ramen. I highly suggest ramen Hitoshi in Walnut Creek for a good solid bowl of ramen, but the ramen is Amakara taste a little instant. Good ramen broth is usually made for hours, the cha siu pork is succulent and tender, and the noodles are firm but fair enough to hold the broth.
Fried food is fried food. It was standard and as should be expected.
Overall I give it a two star. Though it is decent for this area.The wait for over an hour for pricey ""ok"" food is not something I will continue coming back for.
Here are some other recommendations
Oyama sushi
Ramen Hiroshi","2"
"Timir D.","This is probably the best sushi joint that I have been to in the Dublin/Pleasanton/Livermore area.
We arrived late-ish (8:15 PM) on a Tuesday night. There was a long wait, on the order of 30 minutes and I could see many people waiting in the bar area. I looked at the list and saw at least 7 groups ahead of us. We could see two seats at the sushi bar open, so we asked if we could sit there. They were very accommodating and sat us pretty much immediately. Which was a good move on their part, because we likely would have left otherwise since we weren't very hungry and were in a rush.
We sat at the bar for abotu 10 minutes and our order was taken, and then within about 10 minutes our food came. We ordered salmon skin salad, scallop sashimi, and the sashimi platter. The salad and scallop came out first. The salmon skin salad was well made, crispy salmon skin was well balance with fresh greens, red onions, pea sprouts, and pickled carrots, the dish was topped with bonito flakes which added a nice flavorful touch to the dish. The scallop sashimi was good fresh and sweet, but they left a little bit of the tougher side muscle on, which they could have easily removed.
The sashimi platter came out about 5 minutes later. 9 different kinds of fish, 2 pieces of most kinds except for the tuna which had 4 pieces. The tuna and yellow tail pieces were very generous, in fact the tuna was almost too large, but it was delicious so I cant complain. All of the fish was extremely fresh, no smell, even the saba/mackerel (which i normally dont like because its over vinegar-ed) was delicate and delicious. The hamachi was the most remarkable the cut looked like it came from the belly, and was extremely well-marbled. In fact I could say that its the best hamachi that I can recall having. At $28 the platter wasnt cheap but it was well worth it.
Lastly, our waitress was extremely polite, attentive, and competent. I want to add that when I asked to take some food to go, the waitress actually took the time to pack the food in front of me using chopsticks and doing a great job of plating in the takeaway container. One of my pet peeves is when I am asked to pack food myself, not only did I not have to pack, but it was done very elegantly,
I will certainly return, but honestly I will likely get the same sashimi platter again. It was well worth it!","4"
"Joanna B.","There is a reason this place is always busy. It's delicious and has a great atmosphere if you plan on eating in- a bit loud but that is bc every table is full. Not cheap but you get what you pay for. I personally like to call for take out since wait times are crazy. Grilled edamame, any roll and for some reason I freaking love their salad dressing.
Highly recommend","5"
"Bill L.","I have been a fan of Amakara for some time.
When I can't sit and enjoy I order take out.
This time my to go order was taking over an hour.
The chicken dish was ready first along with the shrimp.
The food sat there for over forty minutes the grilled edamame sat with the order getting cold. The only thing left was the sushi dishes which are served cold.
Still waiting for one more cold dish.
When asked to pay for the order after an hour passed I asked if the hot food was now cold. They said yes and we can reheat it while the rest of the order was being prepared.
How come the quick food was prepared so far in advance?
The wait was going well over an hour. I declined the order and told them I will pay for the one drink I had. They should have given me the drink for the inconvenience.
Overall very disappointed.","1"
"Diane Z.","Hands down the best sushi place in the San Ramon/Dublin/Danville area. That doesn't change the fact that this place is overpriced and overcrowded though.
I never come here unless there's a special occasion, because there's always a wait. This particular time I went, the person at the front desk said it'll be a 35 minute wait, and after 30 minutes I checked back and he told me it'll be another 30 minute wait. It's annoying because if they originally said it's a 1 hour wait I would've left. Ugh.
The fish is really fresh and the rice is usually cooked to the right texture. I love trying new things on their menu. I wish they gave free edamame as a starter since this is a pretty high end place?
Anyways 4 stars because I keep coming back despite everything else because there's nothing better in the area when I want good quality sushi.","4"
"Elijah C.","This place has terrible service. One of the servers spilled water all over the table and didn't even clean it up.","1"
"J D.","Hate to do this but got to get it out there. They mess with your bill, meaning they are messing with your money.
Both myself and my friend noticed what was going on. We would pay with a credit card/debit card. I will take my example. The bill was $82 before tip. I left a $20 tip, so total of $102. Checked my online bank account a day later and some how there was a charge of $82 and another charge of $76. Thought it was strange.
Called the restaurant to speak to a manager about it, and the direct words from the girl on the phone were ""She doesn't want to talk to you right now."" I was so blown away, considering they had no idea why I was calling. So I asked to leave a message and the woman on the phone took my name and number. Two days later, no call back from the manager.
Called my bank and said I wanted to dispute two charges. They hadn't cleared yet so she said to wait till they clear. Later that day the $82 cleared. Fine, that's the correct amount. The $76 though was still pending. Checked later in the day, and the $76 ""magically"" disappeared and the new amount was now another $82. So call the bank again, they said they would call Amakara. They called themselves and the same response ""we don't want to talk to you.""
It's now been a few days and everything has cleared. I have an $82 charge and now another $82 charge. Obviously I will be walking in, in person to make sure this gets cleared. But my friend also noticed them putting in different amounts and then all of a sudden they're cleared or fixed. They're playing with your money, not cool. And for them to not own up or take a phone call to explain what's going on, sounds really shady.
PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD! I WILL BE MAKING SURE TO POST ONLINE EVERYWHERE.","1"
"Jenny N.","Service (5/5 stars)
- you HAVE to come here Early and line up to make first seating! No matter what time or day, there's always a long wait. You cannot make reservations for smaller parties than 6 or 8 .. I forget . People start lining up by 4:40pm and anything later than that is pushing it. and doors open at 5pm.
Our waitress was super attentive . They were always busy but always readily available :)
F O O D
Honestly, I come here for the appetizers and the raw fish. The sushi rolls aren't that great to me at all . So I don't bother ordering it.
Hamachi (yellowtail) Carpaccio (5/5 stars)
- MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE item from this place. The fish is so fresh and buttery and firm at the same time. So good ! I love it ! I eat one whole plate by myself.
Salmon Carpaccio (4/5 stars)
- I'm not toooo big on the salmon carpaccio but it's still gonna be good for those who really love salmon. My favorite fish is yellow tail :)
Soft shell crab 5/5 stars)
- I love soft shell crab no matter where it's from. It's always good !
Seaweed salad (5/5 stars)
- taste like every place's seaweed salad. Good enough to eat :)
Grilled squid (4/5 stars)
- the texture was soft but firm which was perfect. It did taste pretty average though which kinda meh. But I would still order it again
D R I N K S
Hot sake (4/5 stars)
- a bit bitter but hot sake is hot sake . YUMMY !!","4"
"Richa P.","I always feel rushed and food good but not great. Plan ahead of time as 60 minutes wait time is very normal it seems. I have tried 4-5 times and amazed at the wait line. Probably that's the reason I felt rushed, not enough time to sit and enjoy food. Food quality isn't excellent either compared to price tag they charge people. Decor is very beautiful and they have enough bar space to offer drinks and dish.","3"
"Joshua G.","I came alone on a Wednesday night. It was very busy. Waited about ten minutes for a seat at the bar. The waitress came fairly quickly to take my order. Then I proceeded to wait about 25 minutes for six pieces of nigiri sushi. I would have waited longer if I hadn't flagged the waitress down to complain. Meanwhile the couple next to me who knew a chef got plate after plate.
Fish was good, hence two stars instead of one. Not fantastic. Good. Service is awful.","2"
