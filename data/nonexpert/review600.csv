"Ryan S.","Went here with my lady on a Saturday evening. The hostess was very friendly and explained it would be 30+ mins for a seat. We ordered a drink and maybe waited 10 mins before being seated. Atmosphere was great! Family friendly restaurant with an upbeat crowd for NBA playoffs (tvs everywhere). Grilled edamame & grilled oysters with mozzarella were perfect starters. We're both heavy eaters, but two rolls with the appetizers more than satisfied our hunger. Would definitely stop in here again!","5"
"Elia Q.","We go here all the time for lunch. The Sushi is delicious but the service is a bit slow.
We love their Mango Shrimp rolls!","4"
"Gerard L.","An awesome option to Japanese food. They have small Japanese Tapas. They have kabobs, grilled sea food and the typical Japanese sushi and dishes. Kinda on the pricey side as many Japanese restaurants are, but well worth it once in awhile.
We also had so Sapporo drinks which kept our appetite going.
Staff were friendly. Service was ok. Not too fast and slow. They also ask you to remove your shoes to sit at the Traditional Japanese table setting, but it's not entirely traditional. You sit like you're on a bench floor -- not really on a floor. Kinda odd why they still ask for us to remove our shoes.
Will come back again for sure.","5"
"M S.","So excited to find a place with great Ramen nearby without having to go out to Oakland or SF! Will come back for more!!!
Great staff as well!","5"
"Nicholas N.","This place has the best Teriyaki Salmon and Teriyaki Steak that I've EVER had. I moved out of state and miss it everyday. It's definitely worth the price too! For only $20 dollars you get a HUGE plate of steak or salmon with rice and salad. They definitely know how to cook. Their sushi rolls aren't bad either. Service is great. I highly recommend coming here if you get the chance.","5"
"Gwendolyn T.","This is by far the best sushi I've ever eaten! The roll creativity is quite daring and gives you lots of options. Can't get enough! Price is worth it but limits how often I can go.","5"
"Shannon L.","I will for sure come back for the Fish Foie Gras roll which is really ankimo/monkfish liver. I have never had it in roll form and it was so delicious! Being in a roll allows the rice to offset the creaminess.
All the food is still a bit pricey. For example, unagi don was $18 whopping dollars. They do give you generous slabs of unagi but I'm pretty sure I can recreate it at home by getting the $9-10 slab of unagi from Ranch 99 across the street.
If you have a big group, they will put you in the back room which looks like it had previously doubled as a karaoke room. I say previously because the machines are sitting in the back but unplugged. It's nice to have privacy but the room is a bit stuffy feeling... probably better with the lights turned off I'm guessing.","3"
"Taz S.","This probably one of my favorite sit down sushi restaurant in the east bay. The food is solid and I especially love their dragon roll.
The only grief I have with the place is that they don't take reservations which makes the wait times really bad. It also means that all the people waiting right by the door get really loud and the ambiance of the place fall short. The noise level when I ate there was so loud that I spent the entire night speaking/yelling at my friends.","4"
"Julie S.","I have no idea why this place gets such a high rating? I've tried twice now and BOTH times I have a terrible experience. Bad service, dirty tables, rolls that have no taste and fall apart.
It took the server 25 min to greet our table, another 15 to get our drinks, literally 27 min before our first roll or edamame came out! Then the server started to rush us and said it was last call because lunch was over. Wtf?? Not only did we have to wait forever on the staff and kitchen, then they rush us to hurry up and finish so they can close??
No thanks, I won't be back, this place is over priced and terrible! Way too many good sushi spots to chose from. Don't waste your time or $ going here.","1"
"Iris C.","We decided to give this place a try when we were passing by on a early Saturday evening. We were seated immediately on a table. First impression, TLC needed for this place. Chairs were deflated, I was like sitting on a bottomless chair, extremely uncomfortable. Big scratches and marks on the walls. Not something I would expected to see in a high end restaurant. Anyways, server was a nice Korean woman and took our order properly. We ordered some nigiri sushi, a sushi roll and couple hot entrees. The hot entrees came fast. Too fast that we had to wait for another 10-15 minutes for the sushi after we finished the hot entrees. With the price we paid, the sea urchin, white tuna, yellow tail, king salmon and scallop were below average. The udon noodle soup was not surprising. The pork chop in katsu don was way too stiff. This restaurant is off on our list - permanently!","2"
"Angela L.","Woops, I added a ton of photos and completely forgot to write a review for this place.
Amakara's menu is Japanese food fit for their regional clientele (read: white folks). It's not super authentic Japanese food, but if you just accept that, it's fantastic. The dishes are innovative and delicious, and if you're more adventurous and enjoy sashimi, this place has some of THEEEE best sashimi I've had in the East Bay. We usually order the tuna poke appetizer, which comes on wonton chips. Last time we sat at the sushi bar, and the chef made us a shrimp ceviche. Not sure if that's on the menu, but it was very yummy. The ankimo is also nice and creamy here. My parents and I aren't much of roll people, but we've shared one a couple of times and it was very good.
The sashimi is the real winner here. Always fresh, and the hamachi is especially good. If you're on the fence because of prices, they also have a pretty sweet happy hour!","5"
"Andrew S.","Best Sushi in the Tri-Valley. Don't order the Salmon (although it's good); get the Salmon-toro which is unbelievable. Same for the Hamachi-toro. Even the green salad and edamame are delicious.
Get their early or prepare to wait.
Service is friendly but sometimes inconsistent.","5"
"Jen C.","My favorite Japanese restaurant around my area. Their menu is lengthy and the food is always fresh and delicious . The wait is usually an hour long for dinner on weekends and they do not take reservations unless you have 5 or more in your party. Best to go during lunch when it's less busier.","5"
"Annie C.","I came here a couple of times based on reviews and wanting to give them a few chances. Their food is good, but not amazing. Definitely not worth the wait. I took my mom here for Mother's day, and the wait was 2 hours. We were told an hour wait. When the hour was up, we went up to the front desk asking how much longer. The lady told us it would be another 15 minutes. After the first 15 minutes, we asked again. She again said another 15 minutes. This kept repeating for another hour, making the wait 2 hours total. They don't take down phone numbers or use buzzers, so we were just waiting inside, which really sucked. I feel like they should have a better waitlist system since there are almost always long waits here.The grilled edamame is the best thing they have there! But it's only really good because it's so salty! I've also had better sushi rolls at other places that have shorter wait times. So I don't think I'll be coming here again.","3"
"Johnny W.","I've been here a few times now for dinner and their food is absolutely fantastic, although you will pay the extra price for it and you'll need to either wait for a table or arrive at an odd hour to be seated.
This place is ultra popular. They close at 9pm from Sunday - Thursdays, and 10pm on Fridays & Saturdays. Two times when I came here for dinner, I arrived there with less than an hour before they close, yet I still had to wait about 20 minutes before I was seated. Another time I arrived shortly after they opened up for their dinner hour around 5:15pm, and I was able to be seated immediately. It seems like another good time to arrive is about 30 minutes before they close, but they do turn off their ""open"" signs around 15 minutes before they close.
Once you're seated, you'll notice that their ambiance noise is quite loud. It's pretty noisy and above your average restaurant audio level. It can be hard to hear someone from across your table. All three times I've been here, they were very crowded. The service is above average for a restaurant that is always busy.
As for the food, all of the entr√©es that I've tried were all good! I always get their spicy miso soup as a starter and I always order something from their original items. The portions are decent, but pretty expensive. It's worth the price for the quality that you get, but if you're really hungry, your bill will be pretty high for sushi. I will definitely continue coming here, but I will prefer to come back when I don't have a giant appetite and when I decide to have either a very early or very late dinner.","4"
"Kathleen M.","The sushi was fresh and the vibes are great. The only downside was the wait was long (about 45 minutes)...on a Friday for dinner. Also, the waiters were not that attentive bc the restaurant was sooooo busy.","4"
"Lorena G.","I'm shocked to hear this news. The fact that health services can shut down a restaurant for rodents, cockroaches, not sanitizing their counter tops and other, is a huge sign that these problems weren't small... they had to been infested to a point to be shut down for days!!!! This is plainly wrong from the restaurant owners. How can they serve their customers food under those filthy conditions? I was a regular customer and this news has made me very upset and left feeling betrayed. Will not be going back. If I'm wrong, Milly you got my number.","1"
"Daniel T.","best sushi in the bay area. I don't remember the exact names of the rolls I ate here, but my favorite is the lemon salmon. fried chicken (karagee) is good. try their tokyo tea its a really strong drink.","5"
"Sherri C.","I was expecting more...
Amakara always has huge lines; the first time I tried to go with my parents we ended up eating at China Village (yelp.com/biz/china-villa‚Ä¶), which probably should have given us a head's up on what to expect in this area. We ordered several items: the sushi combination dinner, the saba shioyaki, Scallops Paradise, tuna poke, soft-shell crab, ramen, and four handrolls. Presentation was nice; fish quality was mediocre. With so many good sushi places, I don't understand the draw. The ramen broth was tasty, remniscent of the Kuro at Maru-Ichi, but much too salty and I couldn't finish half the bowl. The noodles were the only part of the meal that were spot on in texture and flavor, and the only reason why I took the remaining half of the bowl home to try and make leftovers by tweaking the broth.
The interior looks like this was previously an Italian restaurant or steak house and nothing was done to update the decor. Perhaps the bar with the fancy drinks is the draw, allowing people to relax during the hour-long wait and then ""think"" they are eating high-end when they are really just starving! I'm happy Amakara is so popular and wish them well, but I will spend my hard-earned dollars elsewhere. 2.5 stars.","3"
"Katina K.","I've eaten at a lot of sushi places in my time and ALWAYS compare them to Amakara. I have been going to Amakara since it opened. Let's just say I had my 15th birthday party here and I'm 23 almost 24 now. Before Amakara, I was going to the owner/head chef's other restaurant that he worked at in Stockton. To make a long story short this place is good, better than good... it's the best! They are pretty much always busy so make sure to either make a reservation or get there and expect a possibility of waiting (it's worth the wait though).
First thing is first, you have to order the grilled edamame. They are unlike any other edamame that you have ever tasted and will make you actually like to eat it! Other notable items on the menu that I pretty much always order whenever I go:
-Gyoza
-Miso soup
-Red Dragon
-Spicy Crunchy Rainbow roll
-***Scallop paradise (the best)
-Lime Scallop (amazing)
-Spider Roll
-Tempura Roll
There are a lot of other rolls you can order but these are my personal favorite rolls and items on the menu! They also have great lunch specials that give you a lot of food if you are into that sort of deal. The ingredients they use are top notch (you can just taste it)! Their service is so so. It isn't like omg WOW this is amazing but it isn't bad either. Really you're going for the food anyways so what does it matter? If you haven't been to Amakara you are missing out on the best sushi place in the bay area. Once you do go, you'll understand what I'm talking about. Words and pictures don't do this place justice. Trust me on this one and get here today!","5"
