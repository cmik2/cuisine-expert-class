"Matthew D.","Best sushi in dublin. Great atmosphere. Really a fun place to hang out & have amazing sushi.","5"
"Amani S.","My favorite sushi restaurant in Dublin/Pleasanton. With that said, it does get very busy so sometimes going during my lunch hour is not an option but I love everything about this place.","5"
"Jasmin P.","When i feel like sushi this is my first choice great food and always accommodating. I have a service dog and they make sure that we receive a table that can accommodate her. You will need a reservation when coming here but boy is it worth the wait. Although, they don't make reservations for less than 6 people on weekends and without a reservation the wait is usually 45 min at least. Love coming here and will be coming back.","5"
"Shellie T.","I will wait if needed. Fortunately, I go here quite often and have only waited ONE time. It was worth it. Best sushi around and I'm a snob and a half. Consistent, fresh and great staff!","5"
"Kerry M.","Excellent sashimi but the staff is beyond slow. This place is extremely popular because of the food, but don't expect fast or even moderate service. They could expand tomorrow and still fill every seat, but they need to hire more staff! Come on guys, you are expensive, delicious, and popular, hire a few more people!
But if you are a foodie and love sashimi, you must try this place.","5"

"Sean H.","I'm astonished Amakara has 4 stars.
My highest liked Instagram photo is of the sashimi platter.
The hamachi-kama is delicious.
The inari-zushi is delicious.
I blow a large portion of my check here on high caliber sushi, and I'm ok with this.
Take someone on a date here.
Or take your parents if you want to say ""Parents, thanks for raising me correctly. Let me show you that you did a good job and that I make good choices in life.""","5"
"Layla T.","This is my go-to sushi restaurant. Their sashimi selection is super fresh and you can taste it. My family has a majority of our special events here in their back room. We've been going there since its opening and it's amazing to watch the growth of this restaurant just by word of mouth! If you sit at the sushi bar, Ian is always such a joy to talk to. What you have to try is the scallop paradise (I can never pass it up) and the klondike express or the spicy crunchy rainbow roll (I ask for all tuna on mine). The ladies at the front as well as the waitresses are always very friendly and courteous.","5"
"Richa S.","My first time eating sushi! The place was nice without a wait. The waitress was always around which was great because we ordered more food three times! Overall it was a great experience.","5"
"Amanda M.","By far the best sushi I've ever tasted! Sometimes the customer service is a little slow but it's because they are always so so busy! I'm so happy everyone else loves this place too. I wish I lived closer or I would go more!","5"
"Phoenix D.","The portions are HUGE! we ordered way too much food!
Our server was great, we were seated pretty quickly even for a busy Saturday night. They have such a great selection of everything, not just rolls! Boyfriend had their steak dinner and i had some rolls and we also shared some rolls... He's lucky the portions of rolls were so big because they were so good i wouldn't have shared with him otherwise!","5"
"Astha S.","Love the service and food... Grilled edemame is a must try ...
Best sushi place around","5"
"Gianna H.","One of my favorites! Great sushi quality and presentation but dont go if youre in a hurry. The service is slow but the sushi is worth the wait so I typically go for dinner when I dont have time constraints","5"
"Peter V.","Went there with my family for a going away dinner. Together we ordered two sashimi plates with two sushi rolls, the red dragon and the Klondike rolls. The kids had two teriyaki beef rice plate and two salmon plates. We also had two plates of grilled edamame and deep fried calamari. The sashimi and red dragon and Klondike rolls were absolutely delicious. I would definitely recommend the sashimi, especially the fatty tuna, it was delicios! At first glance the price seems a bit steep, but I warn you the portion size for the sushi rolls are huge! We also had ice cream for desserts, and the portion sizes were huge! Also our waiter ozzy was absolutely amazing! He was right on top Of all drink refills and little needs that we needed such as plates and such. Overall our big party of ten plus had a great time and really enjoy the contemporary take on sushi. Will definitely be back to try the bar and other rolls they have! Tanks amakara sushi!","5"
"Adriana C.","This is one of our favorite sushi restaurants! Get here early because they are almost always busy. The food is amazing and the staff are always friendly. Definitely worth a try if you're in Dublin and are craving some sushi!","5"
"Rob V.","THE best place for sushi in Dublin. YES, it's worth the wait - Here's why:
-Grilled edemame: only place I've seen this and makes a HUGE difference in an otherwise simplistic starter
-Spicy Miso soup: another great spin on a simple starter
-Bartenders: fast, friendly, and creative with concoctions. No ego behind the bar here
-The Vibe: friendly serving staff, patrons buying sake shots for sushi bar chefs, amazing GM (saw her handle employee situations without disrupting it affecting her mood, the atmosphere, or customers).
Loc-dawg tips:
-Come early
-Reservations for +6
-You won't be seated until your entire group arrives
-Start at the bar
-Tip well","5"
"Janella B.","So yes it is as good as it gets mind you but so busy during lunch time rush. I ordered ramen but asked if they could put Chashu (pork) in it and they were able to. The noodles were a very excellent texture and weren't gummy like other places that I have been to in the area. I've beent o a few restaurants down in SoCal and this was comparable to the ramen down there. Oh so good. :D","5"
"Jack P.","Makes me bow my head to think about it - so, so good. We are a bit particular being spoiled by another great Sushi Bar in LA Area - Cho Cho San that the family always wants to go to in that area. Even the young kids love it an got hooked on raw fish there.
Now San Francisco is known for its Asian heritage population being significant and we always were disappointed with its Japanese restaurants not meeting Cho Cho San food quality and value standards - but now we have Amakara !!! Amakara's cocktail bar is small but great bartenders and you can have dinner there at the bar. The sushi bar is larger but too small for the crowd, but lots of tables.
Beware that when it opens for dinner at 5:00 PM there is usually a line to get in, but that's what the Bar is for !!! Enjoy.","5"
