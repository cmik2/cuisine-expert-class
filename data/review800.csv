"Dee S.","Made reservations for our party of 11 and the host told us we would get the party room in the back. Once the day arrived and we showed up, they did not recall that comment, but luckily the room was still available for our use (drama diverted!). The room itself is not a VIP experience it is pretty much a storage closest converted into a room with a tv/stereo hook up and random height tables lining the sides of the walls so your party would have to sit in one big U form. We didn't mind and after moving some tables around we made it work. We were just glad to have the space and be loud as we want without disturbing other patrons. We ordered just about everything on the menu, but the highlights were:
-Chili Spider Salmon Roll
-Lime Scallop Roll
-Red Dragon Roll
-Three of a Kind
-Golden Shrimp Roll
-Spicy Ramen (AND OMG is it spicy)
-Katsudon/ Katsu
-Grilled Endamame!
-Otokoyama Junmai cold sake!
Our group was treated well and our food came in an orderly fashion. The wait staff was attentive in refilling our drinks and most of all not freaking out when we split the bill among 4 credit cards. Thank you Amakara, you have fulfilled my sushi cravings and will look forward to coming back very soon!","5"
"Frances P.","Minus one star for the horrific wait times but once you're seated and served, this place is perfection. Very attentive and friendly service, AMAZING quality food, and clean/sanitary atmosphere. Their fish quality is super fresh and portion sizes are great for what you pay for. It is always crowded because everyone loves this place. Despite the long wait, this place is one of the best sushi spots in the whole Bay Area.","4"
"Emilie N.","Trust me, the wait is worth it. I've been here three times in the past four months and every time my boyfriend and I have gotten something different and everything has been great. Definitely get the grilled edamame and crab stuffed jalapeño to start. All the drinks are yummy and the staff has always been very friendly despite how busy they always are. A little on the pricey side but the food is great.","4"
"Jesse P.","Truly the best sushi in the area. You will not be disappointed in the quality of any menu item. Has a long wait time for dinner most nights of the week, but this is only a testament to this restaurants quality.","5"
"Vanessa L.","This is the most overrated sushi place I have ever been to. I cannot figure out why this place has 4 stars. Is it because the Dublin population thinks this is what Japanese food is supposed to taste like? I came here on a Saturday night to an hour long waiting list. We ended up sitting at the sushi bar. The rolls were nothing special, yet pricey. The fish did not taste fresh. The only good thing was the grilled edamame, and my cocktail was pretty good. There are so many other sushi places where the food is actually good and fresh, and doesn't cost this much. If you're looking for good sushi, look anywhere but here.","1"
"Zia S.","I would've given this place 5/5 if the bar tender knew what she was doing. They've got awesome and delicious food, but I encountered a very bad experience when I ordered my drinks. The girl who was running the bar had no idea how to make the drinks. She messed up my Bloody Mary twice, and the lady who was sitting right next to me order a drink she messed that up as well. We visited the place on 11/21/2016.","3"
"Jeffery W.","It's super Americanized sushi. The rolls and donburi are edible and there are much worse in the trivalley. Annoyingly it's usually crowded so the Popeye's down the block starts to look very attractive. I only come here when I don't want to drive far.
2/17/2016 Wasabi Bistro in Livermore is better but I couldn't give it 3.5 stars.","3"
"Omid A.","Personally one of my favorite places in the Bay Area to get sushi! I often take my bosses out here for dinner because of their various verities of fresh fish and delicacies they use for their sushi. The jalapeño hamachi roll is probably one of my favorites and is a Amakara Original as well as the Shrimp Mango. They have very unique flavors to all speciality rolls which I do advise you try, I was however very skeptical to the grilled edamame until I tried it and I fell in love with it. My only knock on this establishment is the fact is their service lacks the type of hospitality and punctuality that would make you want to go out of your way to come there just to eat their, and for that I knock them down one star. (I wish I could only do half since again it has more to do with service then food)","4"
"Woody W.","Yet another wonderful meal at Amakara's. ""SPARK"" was our waiter and helped with a great recommendation of a chili spider salmon roll. Plus some salmon sashim, our favorite Red Dragon, and a hawaiann delight rounded out our meal.
Also the drinks were great, we have had sweettart martini, Neo Tokyo Tea, and Blackberry sage kamikaze.
Great job guys, AGAIN","5"
"Ryan Y.","This sushi spot is one of the best AND busiest spots I have ever been to in the area. The quality of the sushi is amazing! It's really hard to get some good tasting Uni & Ikura and it was by far best quality I've ever had in a while. The only reason I'm knocking a star down is because they didn't have ""real"" wasabi served and that has become a big thing for me recently. It just completes the authentic sushi experience. Other than that, 5 stars for the amazing quality and service!","4"
"Helen L.","The ramen !! On point. Their fish is incredibly fresh. Toro is always good!
Busy as always, call ahead or go with 2 people only. Long waits for groups.","5"
"Fawn L.","Whenever we are up in NorCal visiting family, we eat here. However service has gotten bad. It should not take 45 mins for sushi and they come out at various times so we are always waiting. Next time, we are ordering the mango shrimp and Klondike express rolls to go.","2"
"Miguel P.","Hands down our favorite sushi spot in Dublin. The size the ambiance and of course the food! The chefs are amazing if you get the chance don't pass on the sushi bar. They will surprise you with a special roll upon request. Only down fall is how busy this place is... It's not their fault everyone wants to eat here.","5"
"Kevin E.","This place is definitely a favorite of mine! I've been going for a few years, at least, and I keep wanting to go back for more.
Good:
*A couple of my favorite sushi rolls I always get are awesome, especially ""Klondike Express.""
*It's always buzzing with customers and has become a popular nightspot Friday and Saturday nights.
*Waiters and waitresses are very friendly and courteous.
*Love the bar, nice bartenders with a great happy hour... The sake bombs are awesome and I love the crushed ice they out in the sodas!
*Wonderful atmosphere with high ceilings and huge windows overlooking the outside.
*Great place to bring a date and/or your significant other.
Not-so Good:
*Their sushi options are plentiful, but lack a little bit in variety. I feel like my list of choices are getting smaller, and I'm ordering the same thing, because they're all so similar.
*The service could be a lot faster, as it seems that the waiters and waitresses disappear for longer than expected. The food sometimes takes a while to arrive at your table, too.
*Prices are kind of high, compared to places in the city that are of much better quality food and have more various options.
*Sometimes it gets a little cold there, especially if you're right under a vent. If you ask them to lower the air conditioner (or turn it in) they will.
Overall, I still love the place, because it's a fun spot and the sushi rolls I love are ones I really, really love! The issues I have with them are not enough to keep me away. I will definitely be going back again as often as I can!","5"
"The M.","WOW! WOW! WOW!!! Absolutely AMAZING food.
Everything from the grilled edamame (a MUST order) to the tempura (BEST I've EVER had) to the salads and sushi were spot-on perfection...fresh and full of flavor.
My husband ordered a Rainbow Roll and a Spicy Tuna. He said the fish was fresh and buttery.
Usually, tempura doesn't stay crisp when it cools off, but the tempura here stayed crisp until the last bite.
This may sound odd, but we did find the portions to be a tad on the large side and we had quite a bit leftover, which is rare for us when we eat Japanese. But, how can one complain about over-sized portions?? We also found the prices to be quite reasonable.
Everyone from the hostess to the waitstaff was incredibly friendly.
I removed 1 star because the place is incredibly noisy. My husband and I found ourselves practically shouting at one another to be heard. AND...there was a couple sitting right behind my husband at the bar who were sticking their tongues down each others throats, licking one another's ears and groping one another. It was DISGUSTING!!! The people sitting next to us commented that they expected clothes to start coming off at any moment. Evidently, the couple was friends with many of the employees at Amakara's because the waitstaff and bar keepers kept stopping by and talking quite loudly about personal stuff. There was no way the waitstaff was missing the full on display of clothed sex that was for all in eyesight to see. I wish someone would have said something to the couple, who started becoming more intoxicated through out the next hour and a half my husband were there.","4"
"Ron R.","On a busy Saturday night, the gf and I decided to order take-out. Here's what I ordered:
Salmon Teriyaki $15, Pan fried salmon teriyaki - Two big pieces salmon cooked just right, with plenty of rice!
Ramen $9, Seaweed, green onion, corn, boiled egg slice, tempura bits in dashi and pork broth - Might be a little salty for some people, but still very very savory to me.
Chicken Katsudon $10, Panko fried chicken, onion & egg cooked in dashi broth - An excellent dish, if you're craving katsudon!
The Salmon entree and Chicken Katsudon both came with salad. And I'm not sure if it's home-made or not, but that salad dressing is slammin' good!
Honestly, this place isn't my first choice for sushi, but I love their appetizers and entrees even better! I'll be back!","4"
"Leslie Y.","This is probably my favorite sushi restaurant. I usually get the sashimi salad, salmon lomi, three of a kind, and anything served raw.
I am not a fan of other places who drown their rolls with sauce. I prefer plain and fresh sushi with simple ingredients done right.
Service is typically on point, however, wait time can be long, but I always find myself at the bar having a beer or two to kill time.","5"
"Michelle E.","Hands down the best Sushi Restaurant in the Bay Area. The quality of the fish is A+. I've eaten here many times, it's delicious, very busy, but the service is EXCELLENT.
Beautiful Plate Presentation.
Phenomenal Sushi.
Modern Decor.
Great Service.
Highly Recommend.","5"
"Alexandra L.","Their food and drinks are 5 stars! Really, it's the best sushi you'll find. Too bad it's always so noisy. The hostesses always scream so, so loud (all of them). Someone should give them some etiquette lessons. They also always lie on the wait time. They say ""40 minutes"" when they very well know it'll be a 1.5 hours wait.","3"
"Lu R.","What's hell for the so-called fresh oyster? Too small! They're tiny and taste bad! The restaurant actually sells 2.5for one piece!","1"
