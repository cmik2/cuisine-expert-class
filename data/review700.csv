"Marlaina M.","I would say this place is one of my tops favorite sushi places to enjoy great sushi! FRESH and DELICIOUS!
I was recommended by an associate at Office Depot saying "" there's somewhere around the corner that has lines out the door on the weekends"" and Ding! I was there 20 mins later!
GREAT customer service and the intricate rolls were pricy, but totally worth the price! It satisfied all my taste buds!
I would give this place a big thumbs up!!! Absolutely love that they have a bar too! Love the atmosphere!","5"
"Van L.","Went here to celebrate my husband's 40th birthday.
5:15pm-Had reservations for around 5:15 for party of 8. Was told on the phone that at least 6 out of the 8 had to be there at 5:15 to be seated. 6 of us got there at 5:15 but the hostess changed her mind and said ALL of us have to be present by 5:30 or else we loose our reservation.
5:50pm-Ordered our food. Some appetizers and noodles for the kids and a lot of sushi and sashimi. The cooked food came out very fast and was finished.
6:30pm-Flagged down our waitress to ask about the rest of our order. She said they were down a chef so yeah that's what's going on. From then on, she avoided coming to our table and never checked on us. People who got there at the same time were already eating their sushi.
7pm- Still no food, so my husband ask for everything to be packed TO GO. And a manager lady finally came and apologized for the wait. We just said we should have been informed for the delay then we would have ordered cooked food.
7:15pm-Our ""To go"" sushi finally came and we paid and left.
I understand waiting to be seated but we waited almost 2 hours for our ""to go"" sushi while others were eating and leaving. That is not how we should be treated, especially after I said we were celebrating a birthday!!!","1"
"Andrew K.","Came highly recommended by s Japanese friend. We walked in and the hostess was but condescending. However, we were seated faster than expected at the sushi bar. The food was fresh and good and well-price. No wonder the place was packed! My parents and I enjoyed it a lot.","5"
"Craig E.","This restaurant is packed every day for lunch and dinner. The food is amazing and the menu is very extensive. There is something there for any appetite.
The salmon teriyaki is such a big portion you can make 2 meals out of it.","5"
"Chad Y.","Place is delicious with good portion sizes. Only down side is the wait time. Being so good it's also very popular and you'll often have to wait 30-45 min for a table. Still, would recommend it, just don't go in a hurry.","5"
"Julie L.","Very very disappointing visit today. This used to be our favorite sushi place because their sashimi was always fresh and not overpriced like other restaurants. But today we were told that the owner made the sushi and he basically gave us below par food. The sashimi slices are cut thin like paper yet he overcharged us. And the quantity dwindled so much it wasn't even worth it anymore. In addition, the Uni was of low grade. It tasted bitter and has no sweetness. They must have cut costs to buy low grade sushi.
No wonder it wasn't even busy ok Friday night!! They used to be very crowded and have long waits.
Anyway when we raised the issue the server is very nice but she says nothing she can do because the owner pretty much said it is what it is. Well if that's the way they want to serve their customer then I guess we won't be loyal customer anymore.","1"
"Christy L.","I'd say this is the swankiest sushi spot in the Dublin tri-city area. Extremely nice decor in a huge space. This place is always packed. A restaurant to enjoy giant rolls for sure. Sushi chefs are easy on the eyes too! I've been here on a few occasions and service here has been shotty at times (slow, not attentive, etc.). Again, they do get super busy, but on the other hand, should that be our problem.. Every time? Here are my notes:
* Giant rolls, order modestly
* All the rolls can add up ($$)
* Beautiful and hip restaurant
* Service can be slow on a packed night
* Favorites: Jalapeno Hamachi & Lime Scallop","3"
"Jefferey L.","My son and several of his friends were at this restaurant a few months ago. As they were eating, one of his friends found a worm in the salad. They immediately called the wait person over to show them. They demonstrated little regard for the incident. My son had asked for the manager, the response was the manager has gone home for the evening.
The wait person did not offer any compensation or even change out the salad.
This is unsatisfactory and very poor customer service. Having owned and operatied a restaurant business for 17 years, I can safely say that the restaurant violates food safety procedures as well as health codes. Very poor training of wait staff and poor customer service.","1"
"Madeleine H.","I only eat sushi at Amakara; I realize that's a statement. No sushi compares to the offerings at Amakara, and therefore I would rather pass on sushi when in other cities and wait-it-out to come to Amakara. Fresh fish, all real crab, great flavors. Typically, I go for rolls, but, at this point, I have all of their menu. Here are the standouts, but highly likely anything you choose you will be happy with.
+ Spicy Seared Sesame Tuna
+ Klondike Roll
+ Chile Spider Roll
+ Red Dragon Roll
+ Spider Roll
+ Agadashi Tofu
+ Chicken Teriyaki
+ Spicy Ramen
Options for brown rice on rolls, as well as with entrees. With smaller parties, opt for first available and sit at the sushi bar. Sometimes the wait can be unbearable, but you can wait for a table outside or at the bar.","5"
"Dan C.","The ambience of this place is perfect. One of the better sushi places in the area. Clean with fresh fish.
A lot of the other dinner plates are pretty amazing as well. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area.
Order the steak dinner if you're not going for sushi.","5"
"Corey J.","Take out order. Service was fine. However, the food was pricey and the quality was mediocre. Was not impressed and will not go back. If the price was lower I'd consider, but the price was far too high for the quality of sushi I received.","2"
"Maria L.","This restaurant is by far the best sushi place in the area! Their sushi and sashimi are always fresh and top quality. I know people complain about wait times, but I am willing to wait for a great meal. Also I go right before they open, so I never had a problem. And, regarding their prices, I believe they are more than fair considering the quality and generous portions.
All sushi and sashimi dishes are great. Their uni have yet to disappoint me. Hamachi and maguro, and of course toro are awesome as well.
It's weird to say this about a sushi restaurant, but their Spicy Ramen is to die for! You can also ask them to add chasu for your own version of spicy chasu ramen. Also please ask for Sapporo black which is Sapporo's version of porter beer. Yum!!!","5"
"Zoe D.","Best sushi in the bay area, and right near our place.
Wish they would open more venues since it's difficult to get a table at almost any time in the day or night.","5"
"Mary D.","Pretty trendy, not your typical sushi house. Big attraction is the bar, great wine selections. It was pretty busy, so service was pretty slow. If you're hungry and don't like waiting, this is not the place for you. I would recommend this place for meeting up with friends for cocktails, small bites. Otherwise, go to your traditional sushi house to get your fill of sushi.","3"
"Tony D.","Had my first dinner there & it was terrible..!!! Being here on vacation from Hawaii & also recently traveled to Japan, I wasn't impressed with their service. We ordered a spicy California roll & it tasted like freezer burnt & my tempura disk was well below standard.","1"
"Mareia L.","Finally can get thru the crowd on a wknit still in line for 20 min sample taste of this top rated Sushi place in Tri Valley Pretty satisfied w all the orders compare price for the Quality this can win another star no wonder so popular Very Fresh fish, presentation of food was good I ll be bck to sampler more new variety Save 1 star for room to improve the chef pick sashimi dish need more variety or need more Wow presentation .As a,whole it maintain its rating on the food network","4"
"Vic R.","Sooo good. Always packed with freshly made sushi. It's a bit noisy and hard to hold a good conversation. The food is excellent.","4"
"Nathan P.","Been here a few times, and its always been packed. The atmosphere tends to be on the loud side. Definitely not a romantic environment.
The food has always been excellent. Its our kids favorite spot in Dublin. Some of the dish choices are very unique and plates are well decorated and pleasing to the eye. The food is mainly contemporary Japanese. You've got the standard staples and some off the wall dishes for the risk takers.
Thank fully they finally take reservations which is a huge plus for us. Would definitely recommend to anyone near Dublin craving great contemporary Japanese food.","5"
"Dmitry D.","Nice place, deserves a visit. Very noisy, it's hard to have conversation if you are in the middle of the room.
It's strong 3 1/2 'stars' and I gave them extra half point for quick service.","4"
"Paul K.","Food: Excellent and fresh. I love their Sashimi and rolls. Never disappointed. Their tempura is very good also as it is the type that is very crunchy/crumbly on the outside, yet perfectly cooked on the inside. I've also tried their oyster shooters which are a big hit with me... too bad their about 8 bucks a pop!
Service: Friendly staff, no issues here. Thumbs up.
Ambiance: Nice atmosphere. It is very crowded during dinner, even the middle of the week. Plan accordingly. They don't take RSVP's unless there is a certain number of people in your party.
Location/Accessibility: Easy to get to and parking has never been an issue. They are located withing a shopping center so there is ample parking.
One of my favorite Japanese restaurants in the East Bay... Just very very crowded at times. I've waited an hour once, but it was worth it.","5"
