"Matt Or Marni P.","Best sushi ever. Must try the oyster shooter. If you don't like sushi no problem try something else. Try the red dragon roll or Kat SU don","5"
"Sam P.","Spicy tuna roll was awesome. We also tried the crunch rainbow. I have to say hands down the spicy tuna roll won!!!!","5"
"Nikki C.","How much I love Amakara is indescribable. This is THE spot for Japanese food in the East Bay.
I'll try to get straight to the point with this review so here it goes...
Lunch is busy. Dinner is busy. Prepare to wait. No reservations unless you're a large party. Weekday lunch only and closed on holidays. They open at 11:30a (for lunch) and 5p (for dinner) but you'll notice customers lined up even before then.
Faves:
* grilled edamame
* agedashi tofu
* poke tuna
* grilled oysters
* seared scallops
* hamachi kama
* cucumber salad
* mixed sashimi platter - fresh as they get!
* tempura udon
* spicy ramen
* chili spider salmon roll
* spicy crunchy rainbow roll
* klondike express
* rib eye steak - trust me. Amazing!
* sweet tart martini - a must!
Great service w/friendly smiles all around. Now GO! Or, don't go so I don't have to wait even longer for a table.","5"
"Tatjana V.","We went to this place on a whim. We saw it had a ton of Yelp reviews, so we thought: why the hell not?
Our server for the night was Spencer. Probably the best waiter I've ever had. Ever. A chill guy, knows the menu incredibly well, and is very honest when it comes to recommendations. Definitely coming back for him alone.
We started with the grilled oysters (pictured) which were *massive* and came loaded with mozzarella cheese and pesto. Sounds weird, right? Wrong. Phenomenal. Best oysters I've had, hands down. We also did the half-shell oysters which were LOADED with amazing flavors. Something I've never experienced in half-shells.
Did I mention they have four kinds of miso soups? FOUR. We combined two of them and did spicy miso with soft shell blue crab. Hands down, best miso soup I've ever had.. And if you know me, you know I love a good miso.
The rolls we had were the [extra spicy] red dragon, and seared sesame tuna, and the shrimp mango. When you ask for extra spicy, they sure do deliver. I recommend the shrimp mango as a closer roll, as it's cool, crisp and refreshing.
I am at a loss for words. I have never had sushi so flavorful. And don't be set back by the prices.. These rolls aren't six to eight pieces, like you're usually used to.. These are definitely ten to twelve piece rolls.
All in all, 11/10, would and will eat again.","5"
"Erick R.","I've been to this location 2 other times. But on this visit we were looking to try their ramen. The pictures shared truly give it no justice. The flavors are simply amazing. The bowl I had is the chasu. I truly think this bowl compares to the one I had in L.A. Will I go back ""hell yes"". Their customer service is also on point. All around a very delightful experience.","5"
"Lauren S.","Excellent service and food. Be sure to be there fifteen mins before they close for last call.
Soft shell crab miso. Spicy rainbow roll. Roasted edamame. Plum wine. All on point. Spencer was out amazing server... Def going back.","5"
"Tyler P.","Stellar place to get some killer rolls. The drinks have good flavor and were consistent. Our waitress was attentive and pleasant, she even talk to us for a few min even though it was busy. The rolls were awesome, full flavor with great presentation. Very pleased with my first visit. Made my night.","5"

"Sierra M.","OMGawd! I love this place! If there wasn't such a long wait to get a table, I would go at least once a week! Their drinks are delicious and their food is amazing. Best sushi I've ever had!","5"
"Raymond G.","Definitely one of the best sushi restaurants in the east bay area. If you live nearby and haven't tried this place, you are missing out! Haven't seen a place that trumps this one.
Appetizers - get the garlic edamame!
Cost - you get what you pay for, but their prices are pretty fair.
Entrees - haven't tried but I've heard they're also good.
Sashimi - texture is smooth and fresh, unlike some other places. Superb quality.
Sushi - great variety.....thus, yum.
Service - accommodating and friendly staff. This place gets busy often during dinner time, so come early to rsvp!
Would I come back? YES!","5"

"Kyle C.","Very good sushi.L, very fresh and tasty. Derived a little slow, but it was very busy","5"
"Jennifer B.","Before Amakara, I did not eat sushi. This place has opened my eyes to sushi and Japanese food. I've now visited a number of sushi bars with friends (3+ years later) and Amakara is still our favorite. We have been here countless times and the service and quality has remained very high. You will not be disappointed when you come here for lunch or dinner. Plan ahead though... Get here early or you will have at least an hour wait. Guaranteed. It will be worth it though!","5"
"Molly M.","This is the best Japanese food I've ever had (and that includes places I've been to in SF).
My bf knows I love Japanese food and that, if I could, would eat it every day, for 3 times a day. He said this place was good. And, my goodness, he was right. I'm a sashimi fan, myself. So I enjoyed looking at the diverse options they had as far as Sashimi was concerned (Sea Urchin?? I need to try it!). But they have quite a bit more than that: They have your standard selection of rolls and various other sushi as well.
I got the Mackerel Sashimi, and he got a dragon roll and a philly roll. I originally intended to eat just the sashimi, but my bf's rolls were enormous, and he needed help (Lmao). First off, the Mackerel Sashimi:
-Deliciously salty, yet delicate.
-Smooth, melt-in-your-mouth flavor
-Tasted fresh and clean.
Dragon Roll: Was absolutely delicious; if you've had one before, you know what to expect. Except here, they do it better. I don't know how.
Philly Roll: Deep fried?? What?? This made the cheese taste sooooo good. I'd have never known deep-frying a philly roll would make it so addictive. This was probably my favorite one.
I'm no sushi connoisseur, but I'm truly astonished by how good this place is! Other sushi joints need to step up their game, because Amakara is on point. Everything tastes exactly how you would want it to. Yes, it's expensive, but damn. I can't wait to come back.","5"
"JamieLynn S.","Their sushi is always fresh and they are a lot of different rolls! They have great drinks and the service is good. The wait is long, but definitely worth it. The Lime Scallop roll is definitely one of their best.","5"
