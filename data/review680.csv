"Marie G.","Amazing Sushi!! Awesome Drinks!!
Highly recommend any kind of nighri or sashimi...always very fresh and delicious.
The Hawaiian Delight roll is incredible...bacon, pineapple, salmon, with an amazing sauce!","5"
"Jackie W.","I just came with here with the family prior to Thanksgiving and we had a great meal! First of all I super impressed that the restaurant was packed on a Monday night! That's always a great sign of good restaurant.
Our favs:
The soft shell crab miso soup - I couldn't believe that is was only $6! It was awesome.
$2 beers was a nice touch too!!
The Klondike Express was a recommendation from the waitress and it rocked!!!!
The salmon roll had lemon on top - such a nice touch.
I loved that the restaurant had a little of an upscale feeling, but the prices were very reasonable!
It's great for groups - I'm planning a moms night out there in a couple of weeks.
The grilled edamame was fantastic!","5"
"Jeff W.","I was VERY pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food for the $$ spent. Thats right, two $$. A nice dinner with the GF cost less than $$$ at a sushi restaurant?!?!?! Keep in mind this included a cocktail, then some dinner drinks, and dessert for both of us.
Fish wise, the seafood salad was a great choice, my ""coke bottle"" figure was thanking me for that one. Healthy and delicious!
Give this place a try, it's a nice mix of American Bar, and Japanese restaurant without being too one way or the other, with great grub","5"
"Michelle R.","Aside from this place getting packed on Friday and Saturday nights, the taste of their food is immesurable. I have never tasted a cabage side salad as good as this. I had the tuna ceviche made with sesame chips, and OMG! I just couldn't understand how they perfectly mixed cilantro, lime, tuna, mango, and arugala. Oh, and if you love fried chicken, the chicken katsu is the best.","5"
"Sabrina Marie H.","1st time at this place and I must say....AWESOME! Very good sushi...im a fan of sushi and can be very picky...but hands down really delish! The whole place is set up nicely, and the staff/cooks were On-Point!
Went during lunch time and I had the Rainbow Roll/2 grilled Oysters/Side salad...yea i was a bit hungry LOL
The food tasted fresh and the portions where lil more than average. I forgot to take a pic of the actual sushi roll and lemme tell u...it was all fancy-schmancy...you get what you paid for, thats for sure.
This place is a lil pricey but what you get out of it, its worth the price. I recommend this place and will be returning...ENJOY!","5"
"Lauren S.","We had the chance to go back on a Friday night for dinner. We didn't make a reservation ahead of time and had to wait 15 minutes or so, but we expected the wait and it wasn't bad.
We did get to try the edamame finally and consumed it all within a short time. So delicious! As always, the fish was fresh and tasty.
Looking forward to making this a regular place for us.","5"
"Bill B.","Great food, great servers, and the owners are very hospitable.
If you are looking for high quality sushi at a reasonable price, this
is the place to go.
This is our favorite restaurant!!!","5"
"Jason W.","Love this place! Best in the Tri Valley area! Seared Tuna roll & Lime Scallop roll are my favorite!","5"
"Chris C.","Grilled edamame...delicious!!
This is our go to place when we want to go out for dinner.
I have gone here twice with the wife, both times we were very satified with our selections. All of the plates look and taste very good.
A surprisignly good choice was the Italian Dragon.
You wouldn't think that basil pesto would work on Sushi, but it does!
They also pack up your food for you in a very nice to go box.","5"
"Eric N.","I went to dinner tonight with a friend, we decided on sushi & picked Amakara. After a short wait, we were seated up at the sushi bar, our waitress gave us our place setting & took our drink order. We started off with the grilled edemame which is boiled, then drizzled with garlic infused olive oil & grilled to perfection. This is a MUST have appetizer, once you have it you will know what I mean. For our main course we shared the 12 piece Tuna Sashimi platter & the Spicy Crunchy Rainbow Roll. With our order placed, the edamame arrives, we begin to enjoy them savoring the flavor & thinking who knew these could be this good? We chat with our sushi chef and observe how talented the chef's are in preparing the sushi masterpieces. Our Tuna sashimi platter arrives and it looks amazing!!! The deep red color of the maguro were placed in sets of 4 atop a bed of daikon radish & Japanese greens. As we prepared our wasabi / soysauce mixtures we both commented on how wonderful the dish looked. We both crack the chopsticks & pickup our first piece of tuna, then dip & enjoy! The tuna was some of the BEST I've ever had, I can taste the freshness & the texture of the ruby red fish was perfect. As we dined on the best sashimi I've had since Hawaii, then the Spicy Crunchy Rainbow Roll arrived. Equally artistic, I should of taken a picture of this too but only took one of the sashimi. The freshness of the fish & tastiness of the sushi rice topped with (ponzu?) sauce & spicy red tobiko made for another amazing culinary delight. As you can tell it was a phenominal dining experience, we will be back again & again.
Hats off the our server who kept our drinks full & the hostess who made us feel welcome from the moment we walked in the door.
Cheers.","5"
"Chuck O.","I'm not sure why some people on here are saying the service is horrible? I came here last night (Friday), the place was packed and the service was lightning fast! Frendly too... The sushi was super fresh. This place has some of the best sushi that I have had in a while. Good sized portions as well. The drinks are large and reasonably priced. Looking forward to coming back very soon.","5"
"Stacey G.","I could post more photos but that would bore you.
I could write an entire review of this place but I have done that many times (read my others).
This is a condensed version of my profession of love.
I just spent a few weeks in Fl. I laughed out loud at some of the menu choices there & was shocked at the Krab. Yes, imitation crab. I get it but not used to it anymore. I also asked for fried shrimp heads aka amaebi.
My 1st full meal home was here. At my favorite place. If I keep raving about Amakara, I am not going to find a seat at the bar! All I ask is: save me fried amaebi & a chair.
**I now have a roll. The Stacey Roll :) I'm a happy girl. Thanks Joe, Eddie & Daniel. You make each meal fun, memorable & wow... so good.
Oh yeah! The homemade tamago? I watched Eddie make it the other night. Doesn't get more homemade than that. :)","5"
"Lisa C.","I'm a fan of their salads, especially the sashimi salad- fresh, light, refreshing, and it comes with plenty sashimi pieces. It was a plus that I was able to request a roll (firecracker) that wasn't on the menu.
If you decide to come on a Saturday evening, I suggest making reservations, or be prepared to wait. And if you don't mind, sit at the sushi bar...it was fun watching the sushi chefs prepare the rolls!","5"
"April B.","Definitely the BEST sushi restaurant i've been to in the Tri-Valley area. The selection is great (fushion) and their entrees are to die for. Such fresh salmon teriyaki. om nom nom. It gets really packed on Fridays and Saturdays during dinner, so i would definitely come a little earlier than the dinner time.... definitely me and my husband's go-to place for sushi nowadays.","5"
"Leticia R.","THIS IS THE BEST SUSHI SPOT AROUND!!!
I recommend sitting at the sushi bar to get the best experience. The service at the tables can be a little slow, but at the bar you can see all the creations and get inspired. I have tried a lot of different items on the menu and I have never been disappointed. Yes it can be a little pricey, but so worth it! This place has made me a sushi snob for sure.","5"
"S L.","I went to this place back when they first opened, but hadnt returned again until last week, and since then i'v been here 3 times. What can I say, it's my new favorite sushi spot. Rolls were amazing, grilled edamame is ridiculously good. The place was packed every time i'v gone, but its been well worth the wait. Overall I cant think of anything major to complain about. 5 stars all around.","5"
"Chris A.","Amakara is my favorite sushi spot in town. The fish is fresh, the drinks are good and strong, and their rolls are really unique. The Philadelphia roll with red onions and capers is my favorite, along with the shrimp ceviche. Definitely a Dublin staple!","5"
"Wendy L.","Love everything I get, I've been here 4 times now! Food is fresh and super tasty. Servers are happy and helpful. I love the Klondike Roll and chicken katsu!
I've had a lot of the rolls on the menu and they were all tasty. I have yet to order anything and not like it :D","5"
"Aisha B.","5 stars for the AMBIANCE alone.
I am so sick of going to sushi spots that are low budget strip mall replicas of each other. You know what I am talking about. The sushi will be good, but it feels like you didn't really ""go out"" for an evening at the end of it all.
This place is a stand alone restaurant... albeit within a strip mall (lol), but a restaurant! Because of the space they have, they really took advantage of making it feel more sophisticated. The crowd that was occupying almost every table, the entire cocktail bar, and sushi bar areas, contributed to a very festive feeling. It was loud because of it, but I liked it.
The sushi was super fresh. I loved all the contemporary rolls they offered. We had the Shrimp Mango, Hawaiian Roll (sans bacon), Sake, and Kani. The rolls we huge, and more ""decorated"" than we have seen before... the nigiri pieces were nice cuts of salmon and super fresh REAL crab. All fantastic! We also had a large Asahi and carafe of hot sake- going for sushi is just not complete without it!
For our 5 year old (who was so tempted by the rolls we got, actually tried her first piece of sushi!) we ordered the Sesame Chicken with Ginger Sauce. She really enjoyed it! The portion was enormous- with a salad and rice- not a child's portion... so we had plenty to bring home.
We finished it all off with a taste of the Tempura Apple Ice Cream. The apples were tempura and surrounding a mound of vanilla ice cream. It was different than I expected. But good. Not outstanding. But good.
I agree with previous Yelpers- this is more expensive than your hole in the wall (read ""strip mall"" hee hee) sushi spot... but ya know, if once in awhile I want sushi and actually feel like I can hang out and enjoy the environment I am in, it's worth it.
Next time, I'll be back with some girlfriends to try the tempting cocktails on the menu - like the Blackberry Sage Kamikaze. WHAT?!!!","5"
"Eri S.","Here again : )
The sushi is always great here. The reason why I gave the restaurant 4 stars last time was because of their dipping sauce for the cold soba being too soy saucy. Today, the sauce was just PERFECTO. Therefore, I am adding another star! The waitress - not the same one as the last was very attentive and pleasant! Can't wait to come back here again!","5"
