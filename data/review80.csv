"LaToya S.","I honestly love this place! Best quality sushi! I am never disappointed with my meal when I eat here. The only thing is, the wait time is usually 1hr but it's really worth the wait if you have the time.","5"
"Nicole T.","Hands down the best Japanese place in the tri valley area. Fortunate Enough to get a seat for 2 right away around 5:30pm.
But this place is busy!
Service- amazing! Our server was always so fast at attending our needs and even updates us on our order.
Food/portion- This is just The portion was so big I loved that it was well worth the price!
Since entrees/rice dishes start at 15, you'd expect something good.
We ate vegetable tempura, katsudon, and beef teriyaki.
Also ordered a roll to go.
All 5 starts!
The BEEF OMG. so juicy so tender. The best!!!
Katsudon: amazing.
Vegetable tempura, like please.. I want more!!","5"
"Joe B.","First time at this place. Was busy at lunch time so I'm guessing people must like it!
Was greeted promptly and took a seat at there sushi bar. Good menu, placed my order and it was about 15 mind for food to arrive not to bad with how busy they were.
I will definitely come back for seconds!!","5"
"Barbara A.","My favorite place to eat. Always fresh and worth the wait. A little pricey but can you put a price on fresh sushi? My favorites are the Red Dragon Roll, Klondike Express, and grilled edamame. Great cocktails, I love the blackberry sage kamakaze. I do recommend even though it's already sooooo busy.","5"
"Annaleah M.","Wow. Amazing. Beautiful. Did I say amazing? Found this place on Yelp, and was not surprised. This was the most flavorful, and some of the freshest, sushi I have ever had. There was quite a wait to get in, but the line moved quickly. I can't wait to come back and try more. I had the Klondike Express.
The only thing I might have taken stars off for is that this place is super loud, but the food was so good all is forgotten. Try this place. You won't be disappointed.","5"
"Lusin H.","One of the best sushi places. Food is great, service is fast. The only negative is is the wait time. But it's because the food is good. Little pricey, but when it comes to sushi you have to be sure it's fresh.","5"
"Mrs. B.","Love, love, LOVE, this place. It's worth standing in line for them to open (as long as you get there early enough). Food is delish and staff is always great, regardless of how busy they are.
Hopefully one day they'll open for lunch on the weekend.","5"
"Felicita L.","Delicious! Server was very attentive and helped us with our order. We're new to eating sushi & I'm glad we found this place. You will not be disappointed.","5"

"Brian K.","Amakara is a must try if you're in the area!
I was visiting the area and was recommended this sushi/Japanese restaurant. Walking into the restaurant early on a Monday night, every table was already taken. There was about a 10 minute wait for my group but right after we arrived, another 5 or 6 groups of people walked in and almost immediately created a 30-40 minute wait! I don't know if it's usually this busy but you've been warned (although it's worth it)!
I ordered the Miso Ramen which was very good! The broth was slightly spicy towards the end but I regret not getter the spicier version. It was also a very generous serving size, especially for only $13.
The other people at my table were all envious of my food when it was put down in front of me. But that's not to say their food wasn't good as well; everyone loved their food from the NY strip steak to the Sashimi platter! We also got an order of grilled ademames for the table which were excellent! I've never had them grilled instead of steamed, it's definitely a different taste but still very good.
If I ever come back to the Dublin area I'd 100% eat here again!","5"
"Lea Shawn V.","We decided to come here on a Friday night while we were out of town based on yelp reviews alone. The wait was kind of long almost 40 minutes but it was worth it. The best sushi me and my family have ever tried. Would of posted a picture but we ate it all lol. Definatly coming back next time we are in town!!!","5"
"Marisa B.","Amakara is by far my favorite Japanese restaurant in Dublin. Located in West Dublin off Regional St. Food is priced just right with large portions. Friendly staff. Pleasing sushi bar. Gets very crowded at lunch and dinner. I advise to get there early. There's usually a crowd waiting outside before it opens","5"
"Roxann O.","Soooo good!!!! Loved everything!!!!! Grilled edamames were bomb!! They said 30-40 min wait, it was 20 & they were very busy!!!","5"
"John M.","This place is amazing. Let me warn you now, it will be busy. I first stopped by on a Monday around 715pm. The place was packed with about 10 people waiting to be seated. My wife and I decided to leave and come back the next day. They open at 5pm so we decided to come back at 5pm. It was worth the wait. We easily found a table and we served rather fast. Everything from the wild salmon to the yellowtail belly was fresh and amazing. I highly recommend this place. They are busy for a reason. Great customer service. Our waitress was kind and very competent. Very well run business. If you love sushi you must try this place.","5"
"Kaitlyn S.","This place is the best sushi place in the area! Started with the grilled edamame which is perfect for salt addicts like me. Then we ordered the 3 of a kind, salmon spider Chile roll, and shrimp mango roll. All rolls are not the usual roll you would see at sushi places and was actually really big but we were still hungry so we ordered one more! The last roll we got was the cherry blossom which was more of a roll you could get anywhere but was probably the best quality I've had! Definitely would recommend to come here but the wait looked awful for a Wednesday night so maybe not a regular place to always go.","5"
"Luke V.","This place has the most unique sushi rolls I've ever tasted. Italian pesto with balsamic vinegar and olive oil. Hawaiian with smoked salmon and pineapple. Like scallops topped with tobiko. They all sounded completely different from the usual sushi recipes and each of them blew me away. Fantastic sushi!","5"
"Jon X.","Pretty crowded usually but overall great food and decent sized servings for a mid priced sushi place. I don't know what happened with their health ratings but I'd say I feel comfortable eating here","5"
"Lulu B.","I always go here because it is hands down the best sushi in the tri valley if not the entire Bay Area. It is crowded beyond belief because it is worth it . So tonight I gotta give props to the young man ( no more than high school age) that seats all of the hour plus waiting customers ! Calm cool collected and efficient The gigantic waiting crowd gets ruthless and he takes it in stride. Never stresses and always has a smile. Kudos. Plus best waitress ever is June , tsunami and if you are lucky enough to sit at the sushi bar Jonathan is the man!","5"
"Suzie B.","Omg favorite Japanese sushi place yet!
First time, Friday night, totally packed, and sat at the bar for a few glasses of sake.
When we got to our table, the waitress was quick to take our starter order (which we had been scrolling through the menu at the bar) before hand.
Food was fast, and fresh. The flavors and menu are unique and priced right.
I'm a member of passport unlimited so I received 20% off of food, which brought our bill from $148 to $124... and we had ordered several bottles of sake and the chef's special sashimi. I can't rave enough about how amazing the food and service was! Definite worth it! And FYI my husband and I usually spend about $200 at a sushi dinner and are not as impressed!
Definitely going back!","5"
