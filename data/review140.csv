"Michelle B.","Oh-my-gosh-so-delicious!!
This was my first time at Amakara - I arrived at about 5:10 on a Tuesday night. Good thing I did, by 6:00 this place was PACKED. I sat at the sushi bar and made friends with the guys to either side and the sushi chefs - it's a very friendly place. I ordered WAY too much food. The grilled edamame was addictive, the 2 rolls I ordered (I only ate 1/2 of my order - so much extra food) were also inventive and delicious. The staff was attentive but didn't hover. It was a great experience. I was planning to go back the following night but I didn't get there until after 7 and there was clearly a wait outside.
Get there early. Be open to try new things. Be prepared for deliciousness!","5"
"Steph W.","This place is always busy, but don't be deterred. Any wait is worth it! Fresh, fresh ingredients and best enjoyed when you ask the staff for recommendations. We did that for our entire meal and stepped out of our regular picks to enjoy some excellent food that we didn't know we'd love so much! Supurb!","5"
"Manoj T.","Loved this place .. went there twice and liked everything I ordered both times . Especially the rainbow roll! Will be going again . And my kids loved it too","5"

"Jenny C.","This is my staple for sushi and ramen in the tri-valley! I would take the Chasu Ramen any day!","5"
"Sandy T.","The best sushi and tempura I have ever had. The mixed vegetable tempura appetizer was fresh, crisp, and not a bit greasy. The sushi rolls are inventive, including fusion flavors with popular Italian, Hawaiian, and Mexican dishes. The cocktails were also fantastic. I enjoyed a blackberry cosmo with fresh sage infusion. Refreshing!","5"
"Monica M.","Best Sushi around the Tri Valley
Great drinks too but be prepared to wait as it's always crowded.","5"
"david c.","I've been here many times and the food has always been excellent - so fresh and well presented. The service is also prompt and the staff are attentive. It's a little pricey but well worth it given the quality of the sushi. The only downside is the long wait to get seated.","5"
"Jon C.","Looks like an old Dennys but be prepared for a wait and great sushi. All the fish comes daily and real fresh. Only place I've had grilled ememame. Great cocktail list, wine and sake","5"

"Chris H.","I can't say enough about this place! I first came across this amazing sushi spot back in 2009 when I was looking for date spots in the Dublin/Pleasanton area. And man did I find a gem! I made a reservation for two and they made the rest of the magic happen with there amazing service and very nice decor through out the entire place. The bar was great had plenty of choices and was lit up very nicely. They have 4 beers on tap with one being seasonal type of beer. Good choices with beer your normal when you go out to a sushi place. As we got our seats we were handed our menu very quick and was able to order some appetizers starting with the deep fried crab and edamame both were great! We order the spicy crunchy rainbow roll, the spicy crunchy roll, mango shrimp roll, and two unagi hand rolls. Man let me tell you when you have as good as sushi they served us that night you will make sure to come back multiple times! Awesome sushi! Fresh! Crunchy! Tastebud popping! Sushi! A must go to place when your in the area you won't be disappointed. Make sure your either make a reservation or get there 20-30 mins early because lines form about 30mins before opening at 5pm. Side note on that they open for lunch hours and then close for a bit and re-open at 5pm for dinner hours. Great staff great location great food and good drinks!","5"
"Sarrah A.","First of all make a reservation if you're planning on coming here. BUT don't let that stop you from coming. This place is so damn good. We came in on a Saturday night and got here at 7 and it was an hour wait. The place was packed from the moment we walked in and the moment we left. The fish is so fish. Our waitress was so nice and very attentive. We ordered and our food arrive quicker than I thought for such a big place and it being so packed. The edamame was the best I have ever had. They grill it and it's amazing!!!! Our rolls came out and they looked so delicious. Everything was amazing and so fresh. We drove 2 hours to get here and will be back.","5"
"Sandra L.","Great food. Every time. All the time. Prices are very reasonable. Food is always fresh and flavorful. Be prepared to wait! Place is busy everyday!","5"
"Deborah S.","Love this place. Best sushi in the east bay. They need more purse hooks at the bar though. other than that, no complaints. Martinis are exceptional. Just Millie, Elaine and Eric. They treat you like family.","5"
"Gianna C.","I've been coming here for years and it is still my favorite sushi place. You should make a reservation because they're ALWAYS busy but I mean that's a good thing for them. I haven't tried anything that isn't good at this restaurant. Their grilled edamame is a must have. If you don't particularly like salty food just ask them to put less salt but you should definitely try it. It's amazing. I always get it every time I come here. This time I got the sesame seared tuna roll and toro(fatty tuna) and of course the tempura icecream. I loved how the roll I got was plated and it was very filling. The toro literally melted in my mouth wow. And the tempura ice cream well I get that every time. My sweet tooth loves it but it is a bit too sweet. The service is good and the employees are very friendly. This is definitely a place you should come try!","5"
"Audrey W.","Best sushi place in the east bay. Great food but expected a wait always. Been coming here for sometime now. Highly recommend!","5"
