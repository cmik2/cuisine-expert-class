"Daria N.","This place is just great! Service was better than most I've received in the Bay Area. Food portions are fair and the ingredients are sooo good! Even the next day, sushi tasted great! Definitely my go-to for sushi cravings.
Also their noodle bowls are awesome!!","5"

"Busola O.","Best sushi I have had whenever I'm in town, amakara is a weekly dinner for me. Great ambiance, fresh fish, great service. Best sushi hands down is the spicy crunchy rainbow","5"
"Elma V.","First time to eat hereHave a great experience place is nice although crowded in a regular working day esp for a tuesday lunch time... must have good food to serve. Restrooms are clean & tidy. Receptionist guy is very pleasant & professional. Servers are all attentive So far the best ramen I've tasted but of course noodles are not comparable with Yushoken back in the Philippines. Definitely will come back & try other menu recommended to try","5"
"Iza K.","Husband and I went to try this place on a Sunday night to indulge on a date night! The place was packed but they could seat us right away! Everything we ordered was DELISH!!! We got the Baked Oysters with cheese and pesto and it was sooo good. We also got Grilled Edamame, the portion is huge and I even took a bunch home. We got the Mixed Tempura also and the portion was big and super crispy but husband wanted more shrimp, it only came with 1 piece. We also got the Dragon roll and the FRIED Philadelphia roll. Definitely coming back!","5"
"Mary A.","Worth the special trip!
Our son recommended Amakara for great sushi. It was delicious, service was excellent, serving sizes where big and the price was very reasonable.
I would recommend this place to anyone looking for contemporary sushi.","5"
"Ben G.","This is the best sushi in the whole Bay Area. The quality is amazing. People are so nice and they have grilled edamame!","5"
"Maddie R.","This is my favorite place to get sushi in the Bay Area. Even though the line is always long, it is always worth the long wait. A nice little trick is to get there before 5 so you can be one of the first tables seated as they open for dinner. Amakara consistently delivers fresh, delicious and beautiful plates of sushi. My favorite rolls are the Klondike Express, Red Dragon & Spicy Crunchy Rainbow. They make a great house salad and grilled edamame is a great dish to hold you over when you're waiting for your sushi. The rolls are huge and always delicious! I can't wait to go back soon.","5"
"Lucy Q.","We came here for omakase and loved it! The experience and atmosphere was wonderful. The food was outstanding, ranging from classical servings to unique ones.","5"
"Toni C.","The wait is long even if you get there before they open at 5:00 pm but it's worth it since the food is really good. The tuna ceviche and salmon teriyaki plate are big portions. The sushi are fresh and the soft shell crab, fried oysters, grilled edameme are tasty. I would recommend this restaurant.","5"
"Brandie B.","This place is fantastic! I travel to the area often for business. Great service incredible food. Very high quality. Nice atmosphere and full bar!!","5"
"Jonathan M.","I can't find a better place to get sushi in the Bay Area! I've been here many times and just wanted to leave a 5 star! Its always been great tasting ""get what you pay for experience"". Just had the Chazo Ramen for the first time. My God its awesome! GET IT, Then get an order of tempura to dip into the left over broth.
Be warned its a happen spot and fills up quickly. Also, it can get noisy so be prepared to talk loud.","5"
"Louie A.","Definitely a must try. No wonder its always packed during peak hours. Excellent japanese food, good service.","5"
"Andy R.","Amazing rolls! You cannot go wrong! We have at least 6 rolls between 4 guys and it was just the right amount of food. The rice was fresh and the fish was even fresher. We had the chef sashimi combination and it had some great choices! Certainly coming back! Long wait, but beyond worth it!","5"
"Alexander E.","When we visit the in laws, this is our go to sushi spot. It's a great place for a date night. This last time, though, we went early with kids and the vibe is totally different. Lots of families. So don't be scared off if you have small kids! I've probably tried half the specialty rolls by now, and never been disappointed. We also always order the edamame, which is super tasty and flavorful.","5"
"Megan C.","Awesome fresh sushi!!
There was a line from when it opened but we got there about 15 minutes after and got seated after 10 minutes at the bar.
Kind of on the pricier end for toro. There was an option for $14 from Mexico and $18 from Japan. Decided to spring for from Japan as there was only $4 difference.
The uni was to die for. Small bits but so delicious. I savored every last morsel.
The salmon was also very buttery and had to convince my SO to try it because he didn't know what he was missing out on.
Will be coming back very soon!","5"
"Felicita R.","Love this place. Shrimp mango roll is my favorite. Grilled edamame is amazing. Sometimes there is a good wait.","5"
"Edwin V.","So far this is my favorite sushi place in the tri valley area. Dishes are beautiful! I requested the prepare saki don and it was good!","5"
